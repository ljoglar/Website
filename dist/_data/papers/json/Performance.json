[{"":"","Paper ID":"11","Paper Title":"POLYOP: Visions from The Polyhedral Plane","Abstract":"Polyop are a live audiovisual group using the Web Audio API and Web MIDI API to control live generative WebGL visuals. The Software:https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedronThe visuals run on open source software the group has developed, called Hedron. Hedron is an open source project, written in Javascript. Web MIDI is being used for MIDI Clock (in order to fire functions on the beat as well as modulating parameters using LFOs in time with the music). MIDI is also being used via controllers to manually control parts of the visual system. The Web Audio API is being used to analyse frequencies from the audio part of the performance to dynamically modulate parameters. The 3D visuals in the software are generated with WebGL, utilising the three.js library.The performance:https://vimeo.com/310779808Polyop are from London, formed by Jack Driscoll and Alex Kempton in 2016, and later including Harry Orso and Finlay Macaulay. They have developed an hour long spectacle set in an alternate universe called The Polyhedral Plane.The show follows the main protagonist (a giant shape-shifting demigod) through the universe after he wakes up on a planet from a deep sleep. He comes across a tribe of nomadic aliens who are harvesting a potent psychoactive crystal from a nearby asteroid field. Taking influence from growing up in the 90's, early 3D graphics, electro, breakbeat, techno and early rave.Polyop have performed at festivals and events such as AmsterdamJS, The Lumen Prize, EMF Camp and others across the UK since 2016. They have released music on Nudibranch Records, Tru Thoughts and received support and radio play from BBC Introducing, Worldwide FM, Roy Davis Jr and Rob Luis. Their open source visual software Hedron has become a tool for multiple visual artists across the globe.","Author Names":"Alex Kempton (Polyop)*","Track Name":"Performance","Files":"","Pages":"","Media":""},{"":"","Paper ID":"27","Paper Title":"Performing with QuaverSeries Live Coding Environment","Abstract":"This performance will use QuaverSeries, a collaborative live coding environment. The three performers will collaborate on the website of QuaverSeries, writing programs to produce ambient techno music with its domain-specific language. The first two performers will perform at the conference scene in Trondheim, while the third performer will join the performance online in Oslo.","Author Names":"Qichao Lan (University of Oslo)*; Çağrı Erdem (University of Oslo); Alexander Refsum Jensenius (University of Oslo)","Track Name":"Performance","Files":"QuaverSeries_Performance_ready.pdf (534112 bytes)","Pages":"","Media":"https://youtu.be/qnEiHg6ljTk"},{"":"","Paper ID":"41","Paper Title":"Three Pidgins: Live Coding Performance","Abstract":"We present Three Pidgins, a live coding musical performance as an example of the live coding systems created with Sema, our web audio-based technology.

In the recent three years, the focus has been on crossadaptive processing as a musical intervention in the interplay. More info on the crossadaptive project can be seen at the project blog [3] and also the album Poke It With A Stick / Joining The Bots released in 2019. For more background on aspects of crossadaptive processing and performance, see [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]. For this performance we work with a web-based repository of sounds, explored via a live coding interface [7, 8]. This allows access to a massive archive of sounds from Freesound.org, and the selection of sounds is done via sound descriptors. The integration of this instrument in an ensemble setting is interesting, as traditional and nontraditional modes of musical interaction are activated in dialogue. Using web-based access to the repository allows a generality of instrument design, and this is combined with a strategic mode of performance in this instrument. With \"strategic\" we mean here, that most sounds are not performed directly by physical action, but cued up in patterns via live coding. These sounds are then live processed by other members of the ensemble, responding more directly with physical and gestural instrumental action on the signal coming from the web instrument. The signal is also live processed in a crossadaptive fashion, so that audio features extracted from other performers' actions will modulate the parameters of processing for the web audio instrument. The ensemble also utilize gesturally based interfaces from interactive dance, here used to control elements of audio synthesis and processing.","Author Names":"Oeyvind Brandtsegg ()*; Anna Xambó (De Montfort University); Trond Engum (NTNU); Andreas Bergsland (); Carl Haakon Waadeland (NTNU)","Track Name":"Performance","Files":"WACp-2019.pdf (133005 bytes)","Pages":"","Media":"https://youtu.be/eRWb1zLYL88"},{"":"","Paper ID":"59","Paper Title":"Responsive Space","Abstract":"The performance \"Open Form III\" is created with a frameworkcalled \"Responsive Space\". The framework allows a flexibleway of working with distributed sound and image projections.The system consists of a multichannel speaker-system, 2-3video projections a local Wifi network with a connectedwebserver and mobile devices. The audience is invited to loginto the local network with their mobile devices. In the browserof the mobile devices sound and image is generated orstreamed.As we experienced in previous projects with live audiostreamingand mobile devices the spatial gesture of music as amusical parameter comes to the fore. In the performances theaudio is streamed with an icecast-server. The visual output isgenerated with javascript in the client’s browser.Shortcomings, like the various time delay of the audio-streamof different mobile devices or the variation of spatial and visualoutput, lead to interesting artistic effects. The system offersgreat opportunities to experiment with different spaces and thespatialization of sound and image.","Author Names":"Raimund Vogtenhuber (University of Arts Zurich / ICST)*","Track Name":"Performance","Files":"Responsive Space – Performance_WAC.pdf (133466 bytes)","Pages":"","Media":"https://youtu.be/Nq9-M36XMlU"},{"":"","Paper ID":"61","Paper Title":"gravity|density","Abstract":"\"gravity|density\" is a work for cyber-hacked devices and Web Audio applications. Our goal is to develop systems that merge repurposed and hacked pieces of hardware into the networked world of web art. While the electronic sophistication of mobile devices and the flexibility of web applications allow artists to create immerse audiovisual environments without the use of traditional music hardware, we believe that digital artists should not cast aside the tools of the past, but rather find new and creative ways of modifying them so that they can inform the ways in which we explore and create with new digital, web-based tools. Through these new hybrid systems, we can both embrace the limitations and push the boundaries of any hardware we use for the purpose of creating collaborative sonic environments.In gravity|density, we begin by manipulating fixed-audio sources through the performance of hacked CD players. The sonic results of this mangled audio is sampled and then distributed to the audience’s mobile devices in both passive and interactive manners. Passive distributions allow us to create intricately-spacialized rhythmic interplay between the glitching CD players and the blanket of overlapping samples dispersed throughout the networked audience. Active distributions allow the audience to join in our performance; by choosing small portions of the audio sent to them and send- ing these selected samples back to us, we string this audio together and feed it into a cyber-controlled distortion pedal before sending it back to the audience for more manipulation. This results in overlapping cycles of control and audio generation between performer, audience, network, and machine.","Author Names":"Anthony Marasco (Louisiana State University)*; Jesse Allison (Louisiana State University)","Track Name":"Performance","Files":"gravity_density_wac_camera_ready.pdf (804605 bytes)","Pages":"","Media":"https://youtu.be/ZevQMrmeY3I"},{"":"","Paper ID":"70","Paper Title":"map mop","Abstract":"This submission proposes a music performance to be delivered by the author on a multi-touch tablet.
