A study was completed to determine if this app is an effective means of shifting a user's attention away from anthrophony and to biological (biophony) and geophysical (geophony) sounds while walking and encouraging environmental awareness. Though the model is pre-trained with the author's local environmental sounds, the user can train the model further on their unique soundscape so that each user gets a personalized experience. After the training process, the user can listen to ambient music based on traits of the surrounding anthrophony. If the app senses less anthrophony and more biophony or geophony, then the music fades away, bringing the user's attention to the anthrophony.","Author Names":"Tate Carson (Louisiana State University)*","Track Name":"Demo","Files":"WAC_2019___Demo_CameraReady.pdf (191466 bytes)","Pages":"139--140"},{"Media":"","Paper ID":"20","Paper Title":"Cassettes - An online audio editor","Abstract":"Cassettes is an easy-to-use online audio editor.

The music is automatically mixed by an auto-DJ module that models various DJ-ing styles using content-based audio features that represent musical parameters such as tempo, beats, bars, keys, instrumentation and volume.","Author Names":"Alo Allik (Queen Mary University of London)*; Florian Thalmann (Queen Mary University of London); Cornelia Metzig (Queen Mary University of London)","Track Name":"Demo","Files":"wac2019_moodplay_demo.pdf (1062487 bytes)","Pages":"144"},{"Media":"","Paper ID":"32","Paper Title":"Develop WebAudio Plugins in a Web Browser","Abstract":"We propose to demo an online IDE based around the FAUST DSP audio language [1], that includes a source code editor, embedded compiler and GUI editor allowing to directly test, generate and deploy WebAudio Plugins (WAP).","Author Names":"Michel Buffa (Université Côte d’Azur, CNRS, INRIA)*; Stéphane Letz (Grame); Jerome Lebrun (CNRS); Yann Orlarey (GRAME); Romain Michon (Grame: Centre National de Création Musicale); Dominique Fober (GRAME); Shihong Ren (GRAME); ElMehdi Aamari (I3S)","Track Name":"Demo","Files":"WAC 2019 DEMO _ Develop WebAudio Plugins in a web browser (3).pdf (1547462 bytes)","Pages":"145--146"},{"Media":"","Paper ID":"","Paper Title":"","Abstract":"","Author Names":"","Track Name":"","Files":"","Pages":""}]
