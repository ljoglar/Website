The intervention described explores the generation of content in large numbers of distributed interfaces with potentially large distances across the globe. Using Akson audio-visual (AV) environment, a distributed connection is maintained to all machines that remain publicly linked. We explore and present Wireplex as an artistic use of the Internet creating an irregular platform to reproduce the artwork.","Author Names":"Luis Arandas (Braga Media Arts)*; José Gomes (Portuguese Catholic University CITAR School of Arts: Braga Media Arts); Rui Penha ()","Track Name":"Artwork","Files":"wire.pdf (1364119 bytes)","Pages":"151--152"},{"Media":"","Paper ID":"50","Paper Title":"Acoustic Atlas","Abstract":"Acoustic Atlas aims to digitally preserve the acoustics and soundscapes natural and cultural world heritage sites.  Enabled by web-audio, it is a new but growing platform created by liaising with acoustic teams worldwide to gather and share data on existing acoustic surveys as well as to conduct research on different methodologies of acoustic research in the context of world heritage conservation. The project’s innovative approach will make the acoustical heritage of endangered heritage sites widely accessible. It will bring environmental, educational, conservation and artistic benefits by promoting and enriching heritage research and connecting international researchers and sound artists in the field of heritage acoustics. The online web-audio platform enables Acoustic Atlas to run on most computers or mobile devices and utilizes the built-in microphone and headphone output of a device to transport a visitor to the selected heritage site via headphones and live microphone feed. Any participant can thus interact with the acoustic simulation (termed auralisation) of each site from the first-person point of hearing. The listener can talk, sing, clap or project any sound in real-time, into a simulation to hear the reverberations, resonances, and echoes of each site and thus experience it in a direct sensory way. An immersive soundscape, that morphs between the acoustics of various sites, including cathedrals and caves will be presented as a listening experience.The final presentation of Acoustic Atlas will be available on 29 November 2019 here: https://acousticatlas.de","Author Names":"Cobi van Tonder (Acoustic Atlas)*; Guergana  Tzatchkova (Acoustic Atlas)","Track Name":"Artwork","Files":"WAC ACOUSTIC ATLAS2.pdf (154185 bytes)","Pages":"153--154"},{"Media":"","Paper ID":"","Paper Title":"","Abstract":"","Author Names":"","Track Name":"","Files":"","Pages":""}]
