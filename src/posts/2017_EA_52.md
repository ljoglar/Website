  title: "Runaway Reverie" 
  abstract: "Runaway Reverie is a 3D platformer that also functions as an interactive song. Through the course of the dream-like game, players explore how their movement, location, and interactions with the environment affect musical parameters. This work was built using the Superpowers HTML5 engine using visual assets by Sparklin Labs, and extending the game engine's audio capabilities with Conductor and MultiSoundPlayer classes, which derive inspiration from layer and loop-driven interactive audio engines driven such as FMOD and Wwise. The implementation of these new functionalities demonstrates that such high-level game audio concepts can be applied to Web Audio as well. Finally, the artist hopes that the game will serve as a demonstration that interactive multimedia experiences, especially those that incorporate music and audio as an essential element, can make use of web technologies for ease of access."
