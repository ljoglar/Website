title: "Connecting Web Audio to Cyber-Hacked Instruments in Performance"
abstract: "Artists and composers of distributed and networked music tend towards mobile devices that contain web browsers (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) as their primary mechanism for creating interactive sonic works.  This integrates well with technologies explored at this conference such as web audio, web sockets, web midi, device sensors and click/touch interactions in conjunction with the computational devices themselves.  As audiences are increasingly exposed to distributed  & networked musical performances(D/NMP) presented through their personal, do-it-all devices, the opportunity arises to move beyond this novelty and expand the palette of networked devices while retaining musical comprehensibility. To expand the pool of possible hardware devices capable of controlling, reacting to, generating sound and processing sound in collaboration with web audio-based applications, we present artistic endeavors in creating and composing with the recent frameworks Bendit_I/O and NexusHUB. Together they allow nearly any commercially-available electronic device to be cyber-hacked and performed collaboratively along with web audio applications in typical D/NMP settings.  Interrogation of select historical precedents and an explanation of the Bendit_I/O and NexusHUB frameworks, precede discussion of the “gravity|density” performance showcasing the potential for expanding the pool of web audio art into the realm of re-purposed technology and the Orchestra of Things(OOT/IoMusT)."
