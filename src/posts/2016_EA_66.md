title: "Crowd in C[loud]" 
abstract: "Crowd in C[loud] is an audience participation music piece played on a distributed musical instrument. Inspired by Terry Riley's “In C”, audience members play a short tunes composed by themselves on their smartphones. The collective outcome of the ensemble creates a heterophonic texture of chance, largely in C chord. The instrument mimics an online dating website in which a user browses personal profiles, likes someone, and mingle with other online users. Participants are guided to play music together and to interact with other audience members in this temporary social network. A performer can actively progress the music by orchestrating the crowd by live coding on the console of the web browser. To participate, visit http://bit.ly/crowdinc with your smartphone on Firefox, Chrome, or Safari."
