  title: "Live Coding With EarSketch" 
  abstract: "EarSketch combines a Python / JavaScript API, a digital audio workstation (DAW) visualization, an audio loop library, and an educational curriculum into a web-based music programming environment. While it was designed originally as a classroom educational tool for music technology and computer science, it has recently been expanded to support live coding in concert performance. This live coding performance explores the artistic potential of algorithmic manipulations of audio loops in a multi-track DAW paradigm and explores the potential of DAW-driven visualizations to demystify live coding and algorithms for a concert audience."
