title: "QuaverSeries: A Live Coding Environment for Music Performance Using Web Technologies"
abstract: "QuaverSeries consists of a domain-specific language and a single-page web application for collaborative live coding in music performances. Its domain-specific language borrows principles from both programming and digital interface design in its syntax rules, and hence adopts the paradigm of functional programming. The collaborative environment features the concept of 'virtual rooms', in which performers can collaborate from different locations, and the audience can watch the collaboration at the same time. Not only is the code synchronised among all the performers and online audience connected to the server, but the code executing command is also broadcast. This communication strategy, achieved by the integration of the language design and the environment design, provides a new form of interaction for web-based live coding performances."
