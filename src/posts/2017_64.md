title: "Live Coding YouTube"
abstract: "Music listening has changed greatly with the emergence of music streaming services, such as Spotify or Youtube. However, did it inspire us to make new experimental music? Live Coding YouTube is a response to the anticipation of novel performance practices using streaming media. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service given the limited functionality of the API provided. The piece finds parallels in early experimental music that manipulates magnetic tape and vinyl records. On the contrary, the audiovisual space that a musician can explore on the fly is practically infinite. The performance system is built entirely on a web browser and publicly available in the following address: https://livecodingyoutube.github.io/"
