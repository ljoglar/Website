title: "Synchronia"
abstract: "In search for new electronic instruments and fun interactive experiences, I'm developing a website in order to perform live dance music.
The page itself should be projected on the stage screen for visual and illumination purposes, of course, audio and images are synchronized.
I want to implement some interaction via websockets so the audience can play along, but this is still work in progress...
I’m using Web Midi so I can use my little Arturia keyboard to assign some knobs and buttons. For the audio, the amazing ToneJS library. For the canvas, it’s CreateJS and the rest divs and pieces are VanillaJS."
