title: "Data sonification as part of data visualisation accessibility"
abstract: "The Geiger counter, invented 101 years ago, was an example of audio data visualisation that communicates an invisible threat effectively. But despite the uses scientifically, it hasn’t been explored as often in other forms of data presentation.Data sonification has the potential to add another layer of understanding of patterns in data to an audience, but it could also help improve the accessibility of graphics-based data visualisation, adding an alternative to sending screen-reader users to a table or CSV version of the data.Using examples published in the data journalism community and by artists, I will explore this emerging technique, and it will also look to its uses in scientific fields to take ideas about what topics could be sonified and in what ways.The talk will explore these ideas, with tools such as the recently launched TwoTone alongside experimental audio-based data visualisations created to demonstrate where the concept could go, and how it could be used today to complement graphics data and take data-driven sound design into other areas such as podcasts, video packages or other mediums.I will also talk about the process I went through to visualise 190 million votes in the 2019 Indonesian election through sound, through the intermediate stages of handling the volume of data and the initial audio drafts of representing this data.It will also explore how to signpost the information for the audience, and what approaches could be taken to create a ‘sonic’ legend to allow a user to experience a sonification without any visual cues.I will combine my experience as a data visualisation developer and computer music composer to apply music theory to data interpretation, creating engaging and novel audio formats that allow users to explore data in a different way."
