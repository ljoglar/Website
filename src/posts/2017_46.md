title: "GrainField"
abstract: "GrainField is a performance for solo performer and an unlimited number of players in the audience who participate through their mobile devices.
In this performance, the sound produced by the improvising performer (e.g. a percussionist, beatboxer or singer) is recorded via a microphone and sent in chunks of a few seconds round-robin to the mobile devices of the players.
Controlling a granular synthesis engine, the players perform with a segment of sound by tilting their mobile device.
The players' sounds change asynchronously and smoothly at different phases of the recording cycle of 10 to 30 seconds.
The resulting soundfield is perceived as a diffuse granular echo or resonance of the performer.
The performance is an exercise of collective improvisation that is nourished by the mutual listening of the solo performer and the players in the audience.
The duration of the performance is determined by the performer and typically lies between 10 and 20 minutes."
