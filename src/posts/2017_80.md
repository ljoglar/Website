  title: "Active Server Roles for Extended Distributed Performance Complexity in Diamonds in Dystopia" 
  abstract: "Distributed performance systems that utilize a centralized server for connectivity have the potential to also provide extended computational and storage resources that would not be beneficial or even possible if distributed onto mobile clients. The usage of large datasets, shared or collaborative resources, and processor intensive techniques can be performed on the server while allowing time sensitive and less complex user specific computation to occur on client devices. Many of these types of problems can be solved using tools developed for cloud computing. This approach is demonstrated in the work Diamonds in Dystopia, a collaborative poetry performance that incorporates audience interaction on mobile devices, generation of poetic material on server side resources, real-time synthesis distributed through mobile and venue speakers, a live poetry reading performance and the live synthesis of poetry from the collective ensemble."
