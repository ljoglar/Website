  title: "An Intelligent audio workstation in the browser" 
  abstract: "Music production is a complex process requiring skill and time to undertake. The industry has undergone a digital revolution, but unlike other industries the process has not changed. However, intelligent systems, using the semantic web and signal processing, can reduce this complexity by making certain decisions for the user with minimal interac- tion, saving both time and investment on the engineers' part. This paper will outline an intelligent Digital Audio Work- station (DAW) designed for use in the browser. It outlines the architecture of the DAW with its audio engine (built on the Web Audio API), using AngularJS for the user interface and a relational database."
