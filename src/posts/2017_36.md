title: "Piano Phase Perpetuum"
abstract: ""Piano Phase Perpetuum" is a listening experience that rearranges the first section of Steve Reich's piece "Piano Phase" as an automatic performance for an unlimited number of low-latency mobile devices.
The participants, distributed over a performance space (e.g. the audience of a concert hall or a gallery space) hold up their mobile devices without further interacting with them.
The arrangement follows the original score of the piece in which two piano voices playing the same melodic figure of twelve 16th notes.
Since one pianist regularly slightly increases the tempo, the figures shift in time creating a constantly evolving pattern. 
Instead of two pianists, the piece is played automatically by two groups of mobile devices.
Each mobile device plays one note of the five pitch classes of the melodic figure using five piano samples so that the shifting patterns are create complex echoes and motion in space.
A reasonable duration for the performance is between 10 and 15 minutes."
