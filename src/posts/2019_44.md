title: "Towards Large-Scale Artistic Practice with Web Technologies"
abstract: "In this article, we present a software architecture that explores the technological potential of the web as a programmable interface and as an interpersonal connection point in the artistic practice. This structure exposes the recently proposed Akson audio-visual (AV) environment, also raising a technical evaluation of the technologies and design used to allow the development of both the platform and the network."
