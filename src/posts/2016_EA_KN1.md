title: "Start, Stop, Begin Again" 
abstract: "This talk is in two parts. The first part is about my journey toward a career in sound and radio production – a journey of many years full of related and unrelated starts, stops, and fresh beginnings. The second part is about the founding of New American Radio, a series of half hour radio programs by American artists that aired on the National Public Radio network from 1989-1998, and about the founding of Turbulence.org, where over the past 20 years, over 300 new media works have been commissioned. I plan to discuss a few of the works from Turbulence's earlier years and show the movement away from familiar art forms -literary and musical – and on toward a networked practice. The vulnerability of creative work in the digital medium is noted. In recognition of the longer life span of works in print, I had planned to call this talk: Why I Am Going to Write a Book."
