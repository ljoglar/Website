title: "Smartphony #1"
abstract: "This work is a continuation of my last year's performance "Concert for Smartphones". This time i'm going to dive deeper into spatialized sound synthesis. Main concepts and technical ideas of the performance: 1. network time synchronization for precise rhythmic patterns; 2. distributed diffusion of harmonics of complex tones; 3. different approaches to controlling the musical expression; 4. classical 4-part musical form based on contrasts. Performance duration: 12-18 min. Previous recordings of my audience participation performances are accessible at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivWLK6wnBdU&index=1&list=PL-R2oTCHob0TAGe3_cCWm2rHcVKxCyr3M."
