title: "Diversity Workshop"
abstract: "Two Norwegian organizations working with equality and diversity in technology and the arts sector cooperate with this workshop on diversity. We will present our experiences and work as well as offer some tools to stimulate and achieve diversity in the workplace and in communities such as Web Audio. The workshop will thus have two modules; (1) one first module by The Art of Balance and (2) one second module by Girls Geek Dinner. The workshops will be held in English. Previous knowledge of diversity and other equality concepts will not be necessary."
