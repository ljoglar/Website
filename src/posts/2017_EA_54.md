title: "Piper: Audio Feature Extraction in Browser and Mobile Applications" 
abstract: "Piper is a protocol for audio analysis and feature extraction. We propose a data schema and API that can be used to support both remote audio feature extraction services and feature extractors loaded directly into a host application. We provide a means of using existing audio feature extractor implementations with this protocol. In this talk we demonstrate several use-cases for Piper, including an“audio notebook”mobile application using Piper modules to analyse recordings; a web service for remote feature extraction; and the refactoring of an existing desktop application, Sonic Visualiser, to communicate with a Piper service using a simple IPC mechanism."
