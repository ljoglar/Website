  title: "A Dynamic Audio Experience creation platform in Web Audio" 
  abstract: "This paper describes innovative aspects of the Sonoport Studio, a dynamic audio experience creation platform which will be presented in a demonstration at the 1st Web Audio Conference in Paris. Two key components of the platform are 1) Sound Model templates that represent classes of dynamic sonic behaviors, and 2) Interaction Model templates that represent classes of interactive behavior that are commonly mapped to interactive sound elements. These components, together with a database of sound files and other authoring tools, comprise an interactive audio experience creation platform which is aimed at a typical creative web designer/developer who wants to take advantage of the new capabilities offered by the Web Audio platform, but may not have a deep synthesis or audio processing background."
