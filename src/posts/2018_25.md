title: "WebAudio Virtual Tube Guitar Amps and Pedal Board Design" 
abstract: "In this paper are exposed our latest experiments with the WebAudio API to design different types of gears for guitarists: real-time simulations of tube guitars amplifiers, fx pedals, and their integration in a virtual pedal board. We have studied different real guitar tube amps and created an interactive Web application for experimenting, validating and building different amp designs that can be run in browsers. Blind tests have been conducted with professional guitar players who compared positively our real-time, low-latency, realistic tube guitar amps simulations with state-of-the-art native equivalents. We also created a set of “virtual audio fx pedals” that implement popular audio effects such as flanger, chorus, overdrive, pitch shifter etc. These amps and pedals simulations can be packaged as “WebAudio plugins” and stored in plugin repositories (REST endpoints or local folders). We also developed a “host” application -a virtual pedal boardthat allows us to scan repositories for plugins and to chain/assemble them."
