title: "Extending Csound to the Web" 
abstract: "This paper discusses the presence of the sound and music computing system Csound in the modern world-wide web browser platform. It introduces the two versions of the system currently available, as pure Javascript code, and as portable Native Client binary module with a Javascript interface. Three example applications are presented, showing some of the potential uses of the system. The paper concludes with a discussion of the wider Csound application ecosystem, and the prospects for its future development."
