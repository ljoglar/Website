title: "Frabjous day"
abstract: "Frabjous day is a live-coding performance using a browser-based live-coding environment, gibberwocky, co-developed by the performer with Dr. Graham Wakefield. gibberwocky features deep integration with Ableton Live, possessing a variety of affordances for both musical sequencing and rapidly creating / assigning audio-rate modulation graphs. gibberwocky places emphasis on dynamic annotations to source code that reveal the state of underlying algorithms, including animated sparklines visually depicting synthesis modulations over time. gibberwocky also makes heavy use of a new JavaScript synthesis library, genish.js, to generate musical patterns via digital signal processing techniques."
