title: "Designing and Performing with Live Coding Languages for Signal Processing and Machine Intelligence on the Web"
abstract: "This workshop will give participants the opportunity to learn how to design their own live coding mini-languages and perform with them. Participants will get familiar with Sema, our live coding language design system, a user-friendly, web-based toolkit that provides an accessible entry point to signal processing, machine learning and machine listening. Participants will engage hands-on with our system and learn how these techniques can be used in the exciting domain of live coding musical performance. Additionally, the workshop will include a reflection and group discussion about participantsâ€™ experience with the system and techniques, new features and improvements."
