  title: "WavesJS Tutorial" 
  abstract: "This tutorial session will present WavesJS, a client-side low-level library dedicated to the audiovisual rendering of recorded audio signals and related data in the browser. The library has been designed with a strong focus on flexibility and modularity, and offers a set of extensible building blocks supporting a large range of applications. Along with the submitted paper, the workshop will present the general structure and architecture of the library (particularly the ui and audio components). A more in depth approach of the low level features will be achieved through the implementation of a simple application. WavesJS on GitHub: https://github.com/wavesjs"
