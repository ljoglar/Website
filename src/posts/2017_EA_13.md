title: "Open Band: Audiotype" 
abstract: "Open Band is a collective performance, that deals with a contradiction of the social media, that is the apartness of the individual on their devices social media, to propose a collective sound intervention, were a conductor interacts with the audience through an anonymous chat interface that converts text into sound messages. In this version, we are working only with web audio synthesis, based on an idea of audio typography."
