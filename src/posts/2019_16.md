title: "From the museum to the browser: Translating a music-driven  exhibit from physical space to a web app"
abstract: "This paper describes the process of developing a browser-based version of GrooveMachine, a tangible museum exhibit that aims to foster interest in computer science (CS) through the music-driven exploration of a computational system. GrooveMachine is aimed at kids aged 10-14, and specifically targets learners from from groups currently under-represented in computing by demonstrating CS applications that challenge stereotypes. While an observational study suggests that GrooveMachine triggers situational interest, long-term engagement with CS requires this interest to be deepened and developed. To provide an opportunity for interest development, we have implemented a browser-based GrooveMachine. This not only offers the opportunity for learners to continue their exploration of CS through creative interaction, but provides a pathway to other music and CS learning platforms where they can deepen this interest. In this paper we describe the theoretical underpinnings of interest, how it relates to CS, and how it intersects with identity. We also describe the differences between the museum and browser contexts. We detail the design and implementation of GrooveMachine in the museum and explain how we translated it to the browser, including the rationale behind our central design decisions and a discussion of our technical implementation. In this way we provide valuable insight for researchers who want to reach larger audiences by developing browser-based versions of physical installations."
