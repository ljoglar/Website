title: "Interactive Audiovisual Rendering of Recorded Audio and Related Data with the WavesJS Building Blocks" 
abstract: "This article presents a set of components for the interactive audiovisual rendering of recorded audio signals and related data streams (e.g. audio descriptors and annotations) together with a set of example applications. The components are based on SVG graphics and the Web Audio API. The construction of both, the graphical user interface and the audio rendering of an application relies on a small hierarchical structure of classes that formalize different aspects of the rendering and facilitate both the implementation of complex applications using the provided components and the extension of the library by further defined graphics and audio rendering components. The library and the example applications described in the article are freely available."
