title: "Wireplex, an Extended Flow of Data as Distributed Sound Sculpture"
abstract: "This article presents a networked sound sculpture made using web technologies. The intervention described explores the generation of content in large numbers of distributed interfaces with potentially large distances across the globe. Using Akson audio-visual (AV) environment, a distributed connection is maintained to all machines that remain publicly linked. We explore and present Wireplex as an artistic use of the Internet creating an irregular platform to reproduce the artwork."
