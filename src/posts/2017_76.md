title: "Sound Colour Space – A Virtual Museum"
abstract: "The project Sound Colour Space – A Virtual Museum investigates the conceptual field of sound, tone, pitch, and timbre in its relation to visual phenomena and geometrical concepts. It thus contributes to an interdisciplinary field of research and explores its adequate modes of representation and communication. Many scientists and philosophers from antiquity to modern times have studied the relationships between sound, light and geometry. Their visualisations of acoustical, optical and perceptual topics appeal to the eye and can be studied comparatively. These pictures are interesting because of their diagrammatic structure, as well as how they combine text, images and spatial structures on a flat surface and in the way they address topological, philosophical and psychological questions. They often have an aesthetic value of their own. Besides preparing these diagrams for online publication, we created interactive audiovisual examples that were also used for artistic projects.
