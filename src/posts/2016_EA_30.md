  title: "Personal-JS" 
  abstract: "Personal-JS is a web application based on the Web Audio API and Web RTC standards where connected users play synchronously loops of a well-known song – Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode – together. The user creates or joins a “jam” room, and then can play some audio loops with other users. The application is based on Sync library (http://github.com/collective-soundworks/sync) to synchronize the different devices through the PeerJS WebRTC wrapper (http://peerjs.com) and thus requires no web server, except for serving the audio loops. (As iOS doesn't support Web RTC standard yet in their mobile browser, iOS users can't play with this application. We also encourage people to listen to the lyrics while they will face their Black Mirror)."
