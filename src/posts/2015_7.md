title: "VenueExplorer , Object-Based Interactive Audio for Live Events" 
abstract: "VenueExplorer is a new approach to broadcasting live events which gives more control to the audience than traditional viewing methods. Users can navigate around an ultra-high resolution video, zooming into the areas of the event which interest them and accessing extra content. VenueExplorer aims to be platform independent and runs in the browser. In this paper we describe the development of object-based audio rendering to create a more engaging and personalised experience than that of video alone. We use the Web Audio API (WAAPI) to process audio based on the users viewport. We also describe a library that has been developed as part of this project for the handling of location based audio objects."
