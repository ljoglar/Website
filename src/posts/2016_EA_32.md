title: "The Last Cloud" 
abstract: "The Last Cloud is a live net art performance which reflects on the web browser as a source of form and content. The performance uses live coding to control several browser windows with HTML media, including HTML5 audio and video players, Google Maps, GIFs, and images. This media is mashed up and glitched in a narrative media collage. The work is accompanied by a web audio composition which uses samples, synthesis, text-to-speech, and processed media element streams to put the sound of web browsing in a musical context. The Last Cloud is inspired by the history of media artists who have turned media for reproducing content into instruments for generating content. In this case, the web browser, which was first used as an avenue for viewing reproductions of 20th century media (such as newspapers, photographs, and recorded songs), is used as an instrument for glitching, splicing, and collaging those media, creating a new form of art which could not exist in any other medium."
