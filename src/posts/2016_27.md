  title: "Tune . js : A Microtonal Web Audio Library" 
  abstract: "The authors share Tune.js, a JavaScript library of over 3,000 microtonal tunings and historical temperaments for use with web audio. The current state of tuning in web audio is reviewed, followed by an explication of the library's creation and an overview of its potential applications. Finally, the authors share several small projects made with Tune.js and ponder future development opportunities."
