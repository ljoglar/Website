title: "Ecoacoustics Online: How Web Audio Tools Can Help us Learn to Listen to Biodiversity?"
abstract: "Alongside reducing carbon emissions, conservation of biodiversity is the most pressing environmental issue of our time. In order to conserver biodiversity we need to be able to measure it. Standing in the field counting birds does not scale. The emerging field of ecoacoustics provides strong theoretical and methodological frameworks for the use of acoustic approaches for environmental monitoring: We are learning to listen to biodiversity. Affordable, robust recording devices are now being deployed at scale and machine listening methods used to extract features which provide insights into ecological status. However, research and application is hampered by a lack of software tools to work with the large audio repositories needed. This ideation paper posits that emerging web audio technologies and tools provide an ideal environment and ecosystem with which to address the current and future challenges of trying to organize, assimilate and interpret the big audio data of acoustic survey recordings for ecoacoustics research. A brief introduction to ecoacoustics is first outlined, highlighting some of the key potentials and challenges in the workflow currently. Use cases from recent fieldwork in terrestrial and marine environments given for further illustration. A sketch for an online platform interactive perceptualisation is presented and the benefits of using Web Audio tools considered, including the possibility for rapid prototyping and co-design with parabiologists in community conservation projects."
