title: "The Semantic Music Player: A Smart Mobile Player Based on Ontological Structures and Analytical Feature Metadata" 
abstract: "The Semantic Music Player is a cross-platform web and mobile app built with Ionic and the Web Audio API that explores new ways of playing back music on mobile devices, particularly indeterministic, context-dependent, and interactive ways. It is based on Dynamic Music Objects, a format that represents musical content and structure in an abstract way and makes it modifiable within definable constraints. For each Dynamic Music Object, the Semantic Music Player generates a custom graphical interface and enables appropriate user interface controls and mobile sensors based on its requirements. When the object is played back, the player takes spontaneous decisions based on the given structural information and the analytical data and reacts to sensor and user interface inputs. In this paper, we introduce the player and its underlying concepts and give some examples of the potentially infinite amount of use cases and musical results."
