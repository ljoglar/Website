  title: "Frabjous day" 
  abstract: "Frabjous day is a live-coding performance using a new, browser-based live-coding environment, gibberwocky, co-developed by the performer with Dr. Graham Wakefi e ld. gibberwocky fea tures deepintegration with Ableton Live, possessing a variety of affordances for both musical sequencing and rapidly creating / assigning audio-rate modulation graphs. Like Gibber, another browser-based envi ronment developed by the performer, gibberwocky places emphasis on dynamic annotations to source code that reveal the state of underlying algorithms. A new addition found only in gibberwocky isthe use of animated sparklines to visually depict synthesis modulations over time. gibberwocky also makes heavy use of a new JavaScript synthesis library, genish.js, to generate musical patterns via digital signal processing techniques."
