title: "Loop-aware Audio Recording for the Web" 
abstract: "Music loops are audio recordings used as basic building blocks in many types of music. The use of pre-recorded loops facilitates engagement into music creation to users regardless of their background in music theory. Using online loop databases also affords simple collaboration and exchange. Hence, music loops are particularly attractive for web audio applications. However, traditional musical audio recording typically relies on complex DAW software. Recording loops usually requires consideration of musical meter and tempo, and withstanding metronome sounds. In this paper, we propose loop-aware audio recording as a use case for web audio technologies. Our approach supports hands-free, low-stress recording of music loops in web-enabled devices. The system is able to detect repetitions in an incoming audio stream. Based on this information, it segments and ranks the repeated fragments, presenting the list to the user. We provide an example implementation, and evaluate the use of the different MIR libraries available in the web audio platform for the proposed task."
