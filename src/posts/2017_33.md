title: "Smartphone Orchestra"
abstract: "The Smartphone Orchestra is an orchestra in which ten to thousands of smartphones are synchronised to potentially form the biggest orchestra in the world. An orchestra in which every participant's smartphone plays a unique part. An orchestra that can perform anywhere in the world. From contemporary music to a dance party. From supporting a singer-songwriter to an interactive theatrical piece; everything is possible.

Our technology lets us synchronise thousands of smartphones in the browser and opens up numerous possibilities to tell stories or share experiences with mass audiences. It makes use of new technologies like Web Audio, Canvas, and WebSockets, and allows the user to simply go to a website with their WiFi or mobile connection and participate instantly. Compositions are made in Ableton Live and automatically converted into JavaScript code, allowing composers who might not be familiar with coding work with our system."
