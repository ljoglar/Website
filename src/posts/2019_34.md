title: "Ballot Box Concerto"
abstract: "The 2019 Indonesian election was the biggest single-day election in the world, with an electorate of 190 million people voting for 5 different levels of government over the course of 9 hours. It was the first time the country voted for parliament and president at the same time.This composition takes the turnout as a data source and visualises this mammoth event in sound, using the presidential vote data mapped across the country as the input which determines the synth parameters written in Web Audio API. The votes will be simulated over the course of the piece, which each individual vote contributing to the soundscape that is created.There will be user interaction in that the piece will turn each region into a distinct sound source, meaning that the map can be explored, with different sounds reflecting the different outcomes across the country, as well as accounting for the time zone difference - as each region was open for a maximum of six hours, creating offsets as different time zones ballot boxes opened and closed.The technical implementation of this piece builds on the work I did in my post-graduate research, which took real-time data feeds from video games and used them as inputs to a custom synthesiser that created music based on the numerical input. The composer takes a more formative role, picking the textures that the numbers might create, rather than being able to control the detail.Despite it being a fixed set of numbers, there are technical challenges of trying to work with 130 million individual data points in the browser, so part of the exploration in this piece will be how to handle this amount of data creatively and practically - as possible solutions I will be looking into storing the simulation results server-side and sending them to the user or using Web Assembly.Prototype link: https://observablehq.com/d/07597b321f42b84c"
