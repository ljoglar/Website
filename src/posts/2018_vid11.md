  title: "No merge conflicts" 
  abstract: "No merge conflicts is a participatory performance based on web audio technologies. Participants use their smartphones to access a synthesizer that produces audiovisual signals following touch and accelerometer gestures. An artificial agent character selects and evolves the audience patterns into an audiovisual algorithmic composition played through the sound system and projector."
