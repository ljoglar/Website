  title: "Quiver , Pop , and Dissolve : Three Essays in Gastromorphology" 
  abstract: "We propose a performance that uses web audio technologies to present a unique solution to the challenge of pairing music with the unpredictable choices and actions of diners in a restaurant. Three small dishes by a well-regarded London chef will be served, and audience members will experience a customized music pairing deployed via a web app running on their own mobile devices."
