title: "Quiver, Pop, and Dissolve: Three Essays in Gastromorphology" 
abstract: "We propose a performance that uses web audio technologies to present a unique solution to the challenge of pairing music with the unpredictable choices and actions of diners in a restaurant. Three small dishes by a well-regarded London chef will be served, and audience members will experience a customized music pairing deployed via a web app running on their own mobile devices."
