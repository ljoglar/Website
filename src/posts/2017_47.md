title: "Quiver, Pop, and Dissolve: Three Essays in Gastromorphology"
abstract: "The worlds of art and gastronomy have been colliding with increasing frequency in recent years. As artists are reconsidering the aesthetic potential of the chemical senses of taste and smell, chefs have been exploring the narrative and communicative potential of a meal. The Web Audio API represents a uniquely portable and scalable solution to the challenges of synchronizing sound to a dining experience. 

Working in collaboration with a well-regarded London-based chef, we propose a multisensory performance actuated by the audience members themselves. Three small dishes will be distributed to audience members in succession. Each dish will be accompanied by music from a custom-built web app using the Web Audio API, played from audience membersâ€™ mobile devices."
