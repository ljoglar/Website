  title: "Nü Soundworks : Using spectators smartphones as a distributed network of speakers and sensors during live performances." 
  abstract: "This paper presents the Nü framework. The objective of the framework is to provide composers with a tool to control web-based audio processes on spectators smartphones during live performances. Connecting their devices to a webpage broadcasted by the performer's laptop, spectators become part of the composition: from simple sound sources to active musicians. From a Max based interface, the performer can then control the behaviours of conceptual units, referred to as Nü modules, designed for live composition (distributed room reverb, granular synthesis, etc.). Each module is composed of a pair of JavaScript classes – one for the client, another for the server – relying on the Web Audio API for audio processing, and OSC messages for parameters control. Nü is an open source project based on the Soundworks framework."
