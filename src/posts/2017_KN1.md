  title: "Keynote #1 Probing Rhythmic Synchronization in out Mind's Ear" 
  abstract: "Web Audio enables crowd-sourced surveys involving sound synthesis and interaction. My music-making experiences with collaboration technologies like Jacktrip have led to studies of how we imagine flows of sound in time, particularly those which require tight synchronization. Web-based “active listening” techniques make it possible to gather self-reports from large numbers of individuals asking about how we hear, imagine and produce musical “objects” which unfold in time."
