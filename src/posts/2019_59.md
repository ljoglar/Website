title: "Responsive Space"
abstract: "The performance 'Open Form III' is created with a frameworkcalled 'Responsive Space'. The framework allows a flexibleway of working with distributed sound and image projections.The system consists of a multichannel speaker-system, 2-3video projections a local Wifi network with a connectedwebserver and mobile devices. The audience is invited to loginto the local network with their mobile devices. In the browserof the mobile devices sound and image is generated orstreamed.As we experienced in previous projects with live audiostreamingand mobile devices the spatial gesture of music as amusical parameter comes to the fore. In the performances theaudio is streamed with an icecast-server. The visual output isgenerated with javascript in the client’s browser.Shortcomings, like the various time delay of the audio-streamof different mobile devices or the variation of spatial and visualoutput, lead to interesting artistic effects. The system offersgreat opportunities to experiment with different spaces and thespatialization of sound and image."
