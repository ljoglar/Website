title: "Real-Time Formant Tracking and Visualization using Linear Predictive Coding"
abstract: "I present a real-time speech visualization tool built with Web Audio API. The system takes an input audio stream from the microphone, then uses Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) on input buffers to determine the locations of formants F1 and F2. The formants of the current audio buffer are plotted on a 2D graph, and compared with the F1, F2 averages of 12 different vowels that Hillenbrand et al. collected from a sample a speakers.  The plot is continuously updated to reflect the formant locations of the most recent input frame.  Users can gauge how accurately they are pronouncing a vowel from the distance from the current audio buffer’s formant location to that of the phonemes from Hillenbrand.  This application shows the potential to become a useful language pedagogy tool."
