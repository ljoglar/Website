  title: "Apophenia" 
  abstract: "Apophenia is an interactive music piece that sets out to explore ways to achieve a balance between artistic narration and interactivity in a generative music system. The piece is an exploration in presenting interactive musical systems with an element of narration. The piece is delivered as an interactive musical system that heavily utilises the Web Audio API for real-time sound synthesis, sampling and audio processing. Users are initially presented with a set of points where each points represents a note. The user can use the mouse to hover over multiple notes to generate chords and trigger melodies by clicking. The piece progresses as the user finds special connections between the notes. These special connections will reveal a visual pattern and eventually the user will discover a new dimension in the piece. Eventually, the piece would go back to the beginning where the user can start from scratch. The visual aspect of the work starts with a 2D interactive system made using pt.js [1] library. The second phase of the experience is in 3D which utilises WebGL through Three.js [2]."
