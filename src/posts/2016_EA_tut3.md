  title: "Soundworks Tutorial" 
  abstract: "The Soundworks framework is dedicated to the development of applications featuring co-located collaborative/collective mobile interactions. The framework is entirely based on web APIs and Node.js. It provides a set of services, abstractions, and user interfaces that help the developer to concentrate on the essential â€“ the design of interaction and audiovisual rendering. In the tutorial, we will present the features and architecture of the framework as well as some examples before guiding the attendees through the implementation of a simple application. The workshop will conclude with a brief collective performance. Soundworks on GitHub: https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks"
