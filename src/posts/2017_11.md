title: "Open band: Audience Creative Participation Using Web Audio Synthesis" 
abstract: "This work investigates a web-based open environment enabling collaborative music experiences. We propose an artifact, Open Band, which enables collective sound dialogues in a web 'agora', blurring the limits between audience and performers. The systems relies on a multi-user chat system where textual inputs are translated to sounds. We depart from individual music playing experiences in favor of creative participation in networked music making. A previous implementation associated typed letters to precomposed samples. We present and discuss in this paper a novel instance of our system which operates using Web Audio synthesis."
