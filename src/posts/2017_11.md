  title: "Open band: Audience Creative Participation Using Web Audio Synthesis" 
  abstract: "This work investigates a web-based open environment en-abling collaborative music experiences. We propose an ar-tifact, Open Band, which enables collective sound dialogues in a web ' agora ' , blurring the limits between audience and performers. The systems relies on a multi-user chat system where textual inputs are translated to sounds. We depart from individual music playing experiences in favor of creative participation in networked music making. A previous imple-mentation associated typed letters to pre-composed samples. We present and discuss in this paper a novel instance of our system which operates using Web Audio synthesis."
