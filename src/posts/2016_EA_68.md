  title: "Hooking up Web Audio to WebGL Typography" 
  abstract: "This demo introduces programmable text rendering that enables temporal typography in web browsers. Textual interaction is seen not only as a dynamic but interactive process facilitating both scripted and live musical expression in various contexts such as audio-visual performance using keyboards and live coding visualization. We transform plain text into a highly audiovisual medium and a musical interface which is visually expressive by transforming textual properties using real-time web audio signal. Technical realization of the concept uses Web Audio API, WebGL and GLSL shaders. We show a number of examples that illustrate instances of the concept in various scenarios ranging from simple textual visualization, live coding environments and interactive writing platform."
