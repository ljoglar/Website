title: "BPMTimeline: JavaScript Tempo Functions and Time Mappings using an Analytical Solution" 
abstract: "Time mapping is a common feature in many (commercial and/or open-source) Digital Audio Workstations, allowing the musician to automate tempo changes of a musical performance or work, as well as to visualize the relation between score time (beats) and real/performance time (seconds). Unfortunately, available music production, performance and remixing tools implemented with web technologies like JavaScript and Web Audio API do not offer any mechanism for flexible, and seamless, tempo manipulation and automation. In this paper, we present BPMTimeline, a time mapping library, providing a seamless mapping between score and performance time. To achieve this, we model tempo changes as tempo functions (a well documented subject in literature) and realize the mappings through integral and inverse of integral of tempo functions."
