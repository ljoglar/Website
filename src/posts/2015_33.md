  title: "BRAID : A Web Audio Instrument Builder with Embedded Code Blocks" 
  abstract: "Braid (Browser Audio Interface and Database) is a web audio instrument-building environment developed with the NexusUI platform. To identify the requirements of such an environment, the utility of NexusUI as an audio interface engine for browser-based projects is reviewed. The addition of inline web audio within a drag-and-drop interface-building environment is discussed. A consideration of a modified Model-View-Controller architecture to integrate DSP code and interface is followed by an examination of the work-flow of designing browser-based instruments within Braid. Finally, a database for saving and sharing web audio instruments for performance or audience distribution is described."
