title: "Creating a DJ-ready Web Player for Interactive Music"
abstract: "The talk will explore the motivation, challenges and solutions devised in a year-long quest to build a DJ-ready web player for songsling.studio, a tool Iâ€™m building for publishing and presenting interactive music on the Internet. The player itself utilizes an HLS-like solution as a streaming mechanism, and allows arbitrary changes to the playback speed, direction and content. I will dive into the history and legacy of computerized music playback systems, the dangers of leaving music presentation in the hands of a few dominant platforms and highlight the unrealized potential of our everyday computing devices."
