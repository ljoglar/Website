  title: "HTML Web Audio Elements: Easy Interaction with Web Audio API Through HTML" 
  abstract: "The JavaScript Web Audio API has a powerful but low-level and complicated structure. Therefore, many JavaScript-based wrapper libraries exist, which are intended to simplify its usage. This paper presents a completely new approach, which translates the API into HTML Custom Elements and allows definition, usage and control of complex audio scarios using only normal HTML elements."
