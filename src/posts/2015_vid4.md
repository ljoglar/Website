title: "Can Web Audio be Liberated from the Von Neumann Style?" 
abstract: "The audio programming world is extremely prolific in domain-specific languages. Programmers and musicians prefer a custom-tailored environment where their high-level ideas can be better expressed and implemented thanks to specific domain knowledge. In particular, strongly typed functional programming has become an ideal platform for audio programming, thanks to a concise, high-level writing style, high reusability, and ability to avoid mistakes and improve error handling. How may Web Audio benefit from these ideas? How may such languages benefit from Web Audio? In this talk, we will use the functional audio programming language Faust as the reference DSL, to discuss a formal theory of interoperable and efficient audio components. Particular emphasis will be made on the use of strong, functional-style type-systems. We will address performance, security, and practical considerations, and reflect on the relationship of such theoretical framework to the actual standard."
