title: "moodplay.github.io: an online collaborative music player"
abstract: "In this demo, we present an online music streaming system that allows users to collaboratively choose music by mood, but also personalise the experience by creating private parties where users can control who to invite to join the party and in which tracks can be shared with other participants. The music is automatically mixed by an auto-DJ module that models various DJ-ing styles using content-based audio features that represent musical parameters such as tempo, beats, bars, keys, instrumentation and volume."
