title: "Scrolling Through Sound - Scrolling as a method of interaction with audio on the web" 
abstract: "This paper aims to investigate the creative uses of scrolling as an interaction method for navigating through sound and music. Mainly focused on the use of granular synthesis, the paper explores the interaction model and technical challenges and presents a prototype as proof of concept to demonstrate a case in which scrolling can be used to create an immersive and interactive audio experience on the web.
