title: "Binaural synthesis with the Web Audio API" 
abstract: "The Web Audio API is a powerful new platform for audio rendering within the browser and it provides a great opportunity for large deployment of audio applications. This paper explores the possibilities and limitations of the API for 3D sound spatialization based on binaural synthesis over headphones. The paper examines different processing structures and presents a new web-based server which allows the user to load individualized Head-Related Transfer Functions from a remote database."
