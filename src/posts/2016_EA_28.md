title: "Virtual Sound Gallery: a web stage for modern multichannel music and multimedia art" 
abstract: "Virtual Sound Gallery (VSG) is a web stage for modern multichannel music, sound, and audiovisual art. It is an accessible, web-based virtual reality (VR) environment for a visualized binaural simulation of multichannel sound reproduction. In this environment, a user can change their location among virtual loudspeakers and rotate their head to get the best spatial listening experience. In addition, an integrated video engine provides the ability to play visual content on one or several virtual screens in sync with the audio. VSG provides access to different electroacoustic music compositions presented in several virtual exhibitions and classified by concepts, styles, and organizations."
