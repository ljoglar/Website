title: "Tender Buttons | Sound | Space" 
abstract: "In this performance, we propose an interpretation of Gertrude Steins' poem Tender Buttons, using Playsound.space participatory player to create a soundscape generated live from the text contents. Two performers will dialogue through the chat interface with excerpts of the text while a reading of the poem runs on the background. While the text is render, searches on the system will be made, to access Freesound.org Creative Commons content to create a music improvisation based on the piece."
