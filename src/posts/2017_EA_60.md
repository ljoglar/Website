title: "Compiling Faust audio DSP code to WebAssembly" 
abstract: "After a first version based on asm.js [4], we show in this paper how the Faust audio DSP language can be used to generate ecient Web Audio nodes based on WebAssembly. Two new compiler backends have been developed. The libfaust library version of the compiler has been compiled for the Web, thus allowing to have an ecient compilation chain from Faust DSP sources and libraries to audio nodes directly available in the browser."
