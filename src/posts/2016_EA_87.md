  title: "Improvisation in Gibber" 
  abstract: "This performance employs recent research on pattern manipulation and representation in live-coding performance practice. Using Gibber, a browser-based live-coding environment, I create rhythmic and melodic patterns and sequence their subsequent transformations. Gibber dynamically updates the source code of performances to reflect these transformations, and also injects additional code annotations depicting the current phase of musical sequences and their most recent output. The end result of these annotations is a dynamic source code document, constantly shifting and changing to reveal algorithmic processes to audiences."
