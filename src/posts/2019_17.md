title: "GANHarp"
abstract: "We present GANHarp, an experimental browser-based musical instrument powered by AI-generated timbres.GANHarp is a musical instrument whose timbres are entirely generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and that allows the player to interpolate between these timbres in real time â€“ think of morphing between the sound of a violin and the sound of a marimba while you are playing.We draw inspiration from wavetable synthesizers such as Serum, and the idea of visual latent space interpolation, and provide a novel user interface combining these two approaches.The user interface provides a real time visualization of the spectrum of the sound you are playing, which also acts as a control surface for morphing the sound. The morphing can also be done using a MIDI controller using pitch bend, or automated using LFOs. Additionally, a standard on-screen keyboard and MIDI keyboard input is included.GANHarp is powered by the GANSynth model from Google Magenta, and the Magenta.js JavaScript interface for said model. It uses AudioWorklets for real time sample accurate wavetable lookup, and WebGL for the 3D visualization."
