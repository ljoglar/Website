title: "88 Fingers" 
abstract: "88 Fingers is a performance in which up to 88 players in the audience perform on an automatized piano (i.e. a YAMAHA Disklavier) via their mobile devices. The piano is presented in the performance space as if it would be the instrument of a solo performer (e.g. on stage or in the center of the space). Apart from the web-based system that allows the participants to select a single key of the piano and to play it during the concert, the concept of the performance does not impose any further constraints. The performance is structured into two parts of 10 minutes separated by a discussion among the members of the audience of approximately 10 minutes. The experience establishes a metaphor of a free and responsible society."
