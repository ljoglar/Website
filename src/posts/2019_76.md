title: "Becoming latency-native"
abstract: "The potential richness of audio technology on the internet springs from advancements integral to developments driven by the primary concerns of commerce and science, giving rise to operable and affordable bandwidth in newly-accessible geographical areas as well as the growing sophistication of codecs, browser technology and audio frameworks. Yet use of these tools remains unexplored for music performance, with the primary cause of disruption to performance flows being transmission latency. Through the employment of sophisticated tools and processes, musicians may, however, learn to navigate Networked Music systems as a native performance platform."
