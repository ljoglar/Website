title: "Web Wall Whispers: an interactive web-based sound work" 
abstract: "Web Wall Whispers (www) is an interactive sound work that heavily relies on the web audio technology to enable a virtual high-quality multimodal exploration of a monumental mural. The user's navigation through the artwork generates a unique interactive musical composition at every access, in a challenging paradigm of open form based on a virtual dialogue between the visitors and the composer. The project is conceived as a part of the Segni per la Speranza (spls, Signs for Hope) multimodal artwork, a project aimed at the reappraisal of urban outlying areas. All the constituent materials are freely distributed under the open source GNU General Public Licence, thus allowing the build-up of extensions or new versions of this multimodal artwork paradigm."
