  title: "Delivering Object-Based 3D Audio Using The Web Audio API And The Audio Definition Model" 
  abstract: "This paper presents an application that demonstrates object-based 3D audio rendering in the web browser using the Web Audio API. The application loads audio files containing object-based meta-data and provides head-tracked dynamic binaural rendering of the content to create an immersive 3D audio experience for headphone listeners. The user can interact with the rendering by muting individual audio objects and switching between the binaural rendering mode and conventional stereo rendering. This application demonstrates the future of broadcast sound experiences over the web, where immersive content is rendered on the client and can be adapted to listener context, as page layout is adapted to device context today with responsive design."
