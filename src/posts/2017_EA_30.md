title: "Is Web Audio ready for the Stage / Dancefloor?" 
abstract: "The web platform now appears to have all the pieces needed to drive a full live electronic music setup. We can connect to keyboards and controllers using MIDI, synthesise any sound and process live audio. We can also leverage the vast UI toolkit that is HTML and CSS. We can build a DAW (digital audio workstation), but is it solid enough to use realtime on stage? Could we play an entire show with just JavaScript and a few midi controllers? I have been experimenting with this idea for the last couple of years. Using my own software (with a user interface designed specifically for playing live), I've now played a bunch of semi-improvised shows and learnt a whole lot along the way. From user interface design to squeezing as much performance out of Web Audio and JavaScript, I have a lot to share! For reference, here's a selection of videos featuring me playing live electronic music entirely with Web Audio and JavaScript: https:// www.youtube.com/user/mmckegg/videos WEB"
