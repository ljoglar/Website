title: "Open band - Audio Type"
abstract: "Open Band, a platform for collective sound dialogues, is a performance that aims to experience the empowerment of public in musical context, blurring the limits of audience and performers. In this project we seek to create a web based open environment for people to play music together in a web agora, using web technologies to propose an anonymous open chat, where letters are converted to music. Instead of lone playing experience of the musician with his own instrument, we try to extend the power of individual action through a collective network. In this current version, we are working only with web audio synthesis, based on an idea of audio typography."
