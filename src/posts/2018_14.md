title: "Lost In Space: Indoor Localization for Virtual Environment Exploration" 
abstract: "Lost In Space is a project utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy beacons in tandem with mobile devices and 3D panning on the web to overlay virtual sound arrangements onto a physical location in which users can listen through their phones and tablets. The virtual environments are distributed through a website and are populated with virtual sounds and speaker locations. Users activate the Bluetooth on their mobile devices to scan for beacons. User location navigates the corresponding location in virtual environment. Moving around the virtual environment probes the soundscape. The project also touches on issues of unreliability of Bluetooth tracking indoors, the state of BLE-based project development, and the need for Web Bluetooth development to enable these types of projects."
