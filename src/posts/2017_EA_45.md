  title: "Building an IDE for an Embedded System Using Web Technologies" 
  abstract: "Implementing an understandable, accessible and effective user interface is a major challenge for many products in the microcontroller and embedded computing community. Bela, an embedded system for ultra-low latency audio and sensor processing, features a browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) using web technologies (Node.js, HTML5 and CSS). This methodology has allowed us to create an IDE that is simplified and intuitive for beginners while still being useful to those more advanced, thus supporting users as they evolve in expertise."
