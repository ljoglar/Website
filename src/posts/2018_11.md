  title: "dspNode : Real-time remote audio rendering" 
  abstract: "The author has been experimenting with various implementations of real-time cloud based audio rendering, keeping the client side application as an extremely light weight remote controller, receiving the fully rendered audio stream from a cloud based audio rendering engine. The general benefits, drawbacks and conclusions will be discussed with a plausible and functional example application given for the reader's own performance evaluation."
