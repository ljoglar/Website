title: "Composing Spatial Music with Web Audio and WebVR"
abstract: "Composers have been exploring complex spatialization techniques within multi-channel sound fields since the earliest days of electroacoustic and electronic music. However the reproduction of such works outside of highly specified concert halls and academic research facilities, or even their accurate reproduction within those spaces, is difficult and unpredictable at best. Tools such as Omnitone combine the reach and simplicity of web browsers with the flexibility and power of higher-order ambisonics (HOA) and binaural rendering, ensuring greater accessibility for existing spatial electronic musical works as well as acting as a platform upon which future works for virtual sound fields can be implemented. This paper describes the technical design and artistic conception of one such spatial composition for binaural listening and immersive visuals on the web - “od” - produced in the CRAIVE-Lab, an immersive audio-visual facility."
