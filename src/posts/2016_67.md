  title: "Web Audio Evaluation Tool : A framework for subjective assessment of audio" 
  abstract: "Perceptual listening tests are commonplace in audio research and a vital form of evaluation. While a large number of tools exist to run such tests, many feature just one test type, are platform dependent, run on proprietary software, or require considerable configuration and programming. Using Web Audio, the Web Audio Evaluation Tool (WAET) addresses these concerns by having one toolbox which can be con-figured to run many different tests, perform it through a web browser and without needing proprietary software or computer programming knowledge. In this paper the role of the Web Audio API in giving WAET key functionalities are shown. The paper also highlights less common features, available to web based tools, such as easy remote testing environment and in-browser analytics."
