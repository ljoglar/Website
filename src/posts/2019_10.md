title: "Tweakable"
abstract: "In this paper, I describe some of the core features of Tweakable, a new interactive algorithmic music system.Tweakable is a web-based visual programming system (VPS) designed to lower the barrier of entry for creating algorithmic music, while still offering vast possibilities for experimentation.From a palette of components, users can quickly design an algorithmic system, and expose parameters through a user interface that enable the algorithm to be ‘tweaked’ in real time."
