title: "SimScene: a web-based acoustic scenes simulator*" 
abstract: "We introduce in this paper a soundscape simulator called SimScene, designed to be used as an experimental tool to characterize the mental representation of sound environments. The soundscape simulator allows a subject to generate a full sonic environment by sequencing and mixing sound elements , and manipulating their sound level and time positioning. To make the simulation process effective, SimScene has not be designed to manipulate individual parameters of individual sounds, but to specify high-level parameters for whole classes of sounds, organized into a hierarchical semantically structured dataset. To avoid any linguistic bias, a listening oriented interface allows subjects to explore the dataset without any text written help. The entire software is developed in Javascript using the standard Web Audio technology , and is thus fully supported by most modern web browsers. This fact should allow experimenters to adopt a crowdsourcing approach to experimentation in order to assess hypotheses on large populations, and facilitate the development of experimental protocols to investigate the influence of socio-cultural background on soundscape perception."
