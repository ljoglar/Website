title: "Opening the Dragon's Den: Interactive Welcome to Baton Rouge Entrepreneurship Week"
abstract: "An interactive system was developed to invite participants to the Baton Rouge Entrepreneurship Week opening event. The system consisted of a reactive entryway with an imposing projection on a curved wall, a video tracking and projection system covering the floor of the space, an array of iPad stations throughout the area, and participants using their cellphones to participate in the event. Through these cell phones, web audio was used to create a uniquely personal connection with sound effects and spoken phrases that could not be achieved by the shared public display alone.This talk will cover the technical aspects of the installation including the novelty of pairing video tracking with distributed performance systems to allow for the identification of individual participants and enable targeting them with interactions both on their mobile device and in the public space beyond."
