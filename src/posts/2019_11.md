title: "POLYOP: Visions from The Polyhedral Plane"
abstract: "Polyop are a live audiovisual group using the Web Audio API and Web MIDI API to control live generative WebGL visuals. The Software:https://github.com/nudibranchrecords/hedronThe visuals run on open source software the group has developed, called Hedron. Hedron is an open source project, written in Javascript. Web MIDI is being used for MIDI Clock (in order to fire functions on the beat as well as modulating parameters using LFOs in time with the music). MIDI is also being used via controllers to manually control parts of the visual system. The Web Audio API is being used to analyse frequencies from the audio part of the performance to dynamically modulate parameters. The 3D visuals in the software are generated with WebGL, utilising the three.js library.The performance:https://vimeo.com/310779808Polyop are from London, formed by Jack Driscoll and Alex Kempton in 2016, and later including Harry Orso and Finlay Macaulay. They have developed an hour long spectacle set in an alternate universe called The Polyhedral Plane.The show follows the main protagonist (a giant shape-shifting demigod) through the universe after he wakes up on a planet from a deep sleep. He comes across a tribe of nomadic aliens who are harvesting a potent psychoactive crystal from a nearby asteroid field. Taking influence from growing up in the 90's, early 3D graphics, electro, breakbeat, techno and early rave.Polyop have performed at festivals and events such as AmsterdamJS, The Lumen Prize, EMF Camp and others across the UK since 2016. They have released music on Nudibranch Records, Tru Thoughts and received support and radio play from BBC Introducing, Worldwide FM, Roy Davis Jr and Rob Luis. Their open source visual software Hedron has become a tool for multiple visual artists across the globe."
