title: "Usage of Physics Engines for UI Design in NexusUI" 
abstract: "In preparation to expand the experimental interfaces in NexusUI widgets, the authors have been evaluating physics engines and exploring physics-based user interfaces on the web. Tying physics simulation events, influenced by user interactions, to web audio encourages exploration of novel methods of interactivity between users and web-based instruments. Object collisions, deformation of a mesh of objects with elastic connections, and liquid simulation via particle generation were identified as systems with dynamics that may provide interesting links to audio synthesis. Two popular physics engines explored are LiquidFun and Matter.js, with new prototype widgets taking advantage of LiquidFun's Elastic Particles and Matter.js' Cloth and Newton's Cradle composites. One of our goals is to discover methods of audio synthesis that complement the behaviors of each physical simulation."
