  title: "Usage of Physics Engines for UI Design in NexusUI" 
  abstract: "In preparation to expand the experimental interfaces in NexusUI widgets, the authors have been evaluating physics engines and exploring physics-based user interfaces on the web. Tying physics simulation events, influenced by user interactions, to web audio encourages exploration of novel methods of interactivity between users and web-based in- struments. Object collisions, deformation of a mesh of ob- jects with elastic connections, and liquid simulation via par- ticle generation were identified as systems with dynamics that may provide interesting links to audio synthesis. Two popular physics engines explored are LiquidFun and Mat- ter.js, with new prototype widgets taking advantage of Liq- uidFun's Elastic Particles and Matter.js' Cloth and New- ton's Cradle composites. One of our goals is to discover methods of audio synthesis that complement the behaviors of each physical simulation."
