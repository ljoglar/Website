title: "Soundworks - A Framework for Networked Music Systems on the Web - State of Affairs and New Developments"
abstract: "This paper presents a novel major version of soundworks, a framework dedicated at developing distributed multimedia applications on the web and entirely written in javascript. Since its first release in 2015, the framework has served as a basis for numerous artistic and research projects such as concerts, installations, workshops, teaching or experimental setups. These diverse use cases and situations permitted to validate numerous aspects of the framework but also showed some limitations—particularly in terms of inclusion of non-expert developers such as artists and researchers—leading to the novel version presented here.The paper first presents some applications developed in the last year and show that, despite their idiosyncrasies, recurring problems have emerged during their elaboration and development (e.g. state-management). Second, we present new design and implementation aspects of the framework developed to overcome these issues. Finally we describe a simple testbed application—designed to summarize a number of recurring features and constraints encountered in Network Music Systems—and some elements of its implementation within soundworks.We believe that this novel version will provide solid foundations for the design and implementation of higher-level tools dedicated to non-expert developers, and thereby, foster new artistic, techno- logical and epistemic areas. The soundworks framework is open-source and released under BSD-3-Clause license."
