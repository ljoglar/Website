title: "Building Interactive Systems with WebSockets and Csound" 
abstract: "In this demo, we show interactive systems that use Csound's web-audio related builds – Csound for Portable Native Client (PNaCl), and Emscripten as their primary sound synthesis engine; and a server side build based on Node.js. We use WebSockets and modern implementations of Socket-based transports such as Socket.io to connect participants seamlessly to each other. Our demos explore three use cases – a collaborative sound design tool; a networked music performance system over the internet; and a networked music performance system over a local area network. We will also demonstrate the differences between using Csound as the synthesis engine on the server side vs using Csound as the synthesis engine on the client side. The end result is a robust interactive networked music system that can be used from multiple platforms."
