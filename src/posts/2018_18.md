title: "Participatory musical improvisations with Playsound.space" 
abstract: "Playsound.space is a web-based tool to search for and play Creative Commons licensed-sounds, which can be applied to free improvisation, experimental music production and soundscape composition. It provides fast access to about 400k non-musical and musical sounds provided by Freesound and allows users to play/loop single or multiple sounds retrieved through text-based search. Sound discovery is facilitated by the use of semantic searches and sound visual representations (spectrograms). After feedback gathered from user tests and practices with the tool as an instrument, we identified several directions to develop the expressive and collaborative capabilities of the tool. We present additional features for more complex audio processing, and also to enhance participation trough a chat system that allows users to share sound sessions and exchange messages while playing."
