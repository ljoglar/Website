title: "Improving time travel experience by combining annotations" 
abstract: "Since recorded audio material is played, navigating relevantly through it is a key expectation. This paper provides a formalism to introduce flexible navigation systems based on sets of annotations applying to the same audio object. It aims to build web interfaces to explore audio in time, robust for large data-sets and long files. Introducing the concept of weights applied to annotations, it specifies a parameterized version of the functionality next/previous and presents an effective implementation."
