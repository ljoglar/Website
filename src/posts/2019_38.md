title: "FAUST online IDE: dynamically compile and publish FAUST code as WebAudio Plugins"
abstract: "Developing or porting existing audio and MIDI effects or instruments for the Web platform is a hot topic. Several initiatives, like business enterprise based ones (Propellerhead recently presented its Rack Extension running on the Web1), to more community based open-source projects are emerging. All of them aim to facilitate porting existing code base (usually developed in native languages like C/C++) as well as facilitating the use of existing audio DSP languages and platforms.We present a solution based around the FAUST DSP audio language, its redesigned Web based editor, and the integration of a plugin GUI editor allowing to directly test, generate and deploy WebAudio Plugins (WAP). This recently proposed plugin format aims to facilitate the integration of pure native WebAudio based components, some ported from native languages like C/C++, as well as plugins written in audio DSP Domain Specific Languages. The paper will describe the complete workflow, from the Faust DSP source written and tested in a fully functional editor to a self-contained plugin running in a separate host application."
