  title: "Constellation: A Musical Exploration of Phone-Based Audience Interaction Roles" 
  abstract: "With Constellation, we explore a system for audience interaction with performers during a music performance. We seek to reconfigure the relationship between the audience and performers by designing a system for interaction during a music performance using mobile devices. Additionally, we aim to augment the listening experience in a music performance by using mobile devices as speakers. Constellation was designed and built for the Spring 2015 Princeton Laptop Orchestra concert. We designed four sections to the piece, exploring various roles played by performers and the audience. We conclude by discussing the results and suggesting potential future work."
