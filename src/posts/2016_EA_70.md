title: "Schroeder: A Web Audio Musical Instrument" 
abstract: "Schroeder is a hardware musical instrument (a standalone Wurlitzer clone) built on the Web Audio API. Applications for the Web Audio API will rarely utilize the API alone, but must instead integrate with other technologies/APIs. This is true for websites using web audio as well as hardware projects. This project explores the particular challenges of using web audio to build a simple hardware musical instrument, from fitting a computer in a box with speakers and a MIDI keyboard to implementing a web interface with no screen."
