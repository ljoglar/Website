title: "Intelligent audio plugin framework for the Web Audio API" 
abstract: "The Web Audio API introduced native audio processing into web browsers. Audio plugin standards have been created for developers to create audio-rich processors and deploy them into media rich websites. It is critical these standards support flexible designs with clear host-plugin interaction to ease integration and avoid non-standard plugins. Intelligent features should be embedded into standards to help develop next-generation interfaces and designs. This paper presents a discussion on audio plugins in the web audio API, how they should behave and leverage web technologies with an overview of current standards."
