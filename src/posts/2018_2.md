  title: "A Javascript Library for Flexible Visualization of Audio Descriptors" 
  abstract: "Research in audio analysis has provided a large number of ways to describe audio recordings, which can be used for enhancing their visual representation in web applications. In this paper we present fav.js, a Javascript library for flexible visualization of audio descriptors. We explain the proposed design and demonstrate its potential for web audio applications through several visualization examples."
