title: "Introduction to Percussion Synthesis Using Web Audio" 
abstract: "Introduction to Percussion Synthesis Using Web Audio will introduce participants to the basics of web audio programming. This tutorial will begin with a discussion of the audio graph. Participants will construct a simple graph by connecting standard nodes, including the OscillatorNode, BiquadFilterNode and GainNode, and learn how to generate white noise. The second part of the tutorial will introduce the AudioParam object. Participants will learn how to schedule changes to AudioParam values by creating an attack-decay (AD) envelope generator. The third part of the tutorial will demonstrate how the previous exercises can be combined into a flexible percussion synthesizer. Participants should come prepared with a computer with a plain text and web browser (Chrome, Firefox or Safari) installed and should have basic familiarity with JavaScript. About the presenter: Tony Wallace is a software developer specializing in web and mobile applications, and a former professional musician, music teacher and instructional video author. He is the president of Irritant Creative Inc. and creator of the WebX0X drum synthesizer and sequencer (https://webx0x.com). Tony resides in Oakville, Ontario Canada."
