  title: "ARCADE 3D-audio codec: an implementation for the web" 
  abstract: "This poster introduces the implementation of the ARCADE 3D-audio codec for web browsers. ARCADE can embed a full 3D audio scene in a simple stereocompatible audio stream that can be further compressed with standard lossy compression schemes, aired to analog or digital radio receivers or even stored on analog supports. An ARCADEencoded stream can be decoded to any 2D or 3D-audio rendering format, for instance using Vector-Based Amplitude Panning (VBAP), Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA), or personalized binaural with headtracking. ARCADE adapts seamlessly to the audio industry needs, from storage to production, distribution/delivery, and rendering. It finds uses in Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR), movies, gaming, music, telepresence & teleconferencing. We present a JavaScript (JS) and Web Audio API implementation of the ARCADE decoder, which was originally written in C++11, along with technical details of the porting operations. Live demos of 3D-audio content transmission, decoding and dynamic binaural rendering will be given during the poster session."
