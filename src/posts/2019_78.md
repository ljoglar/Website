title: "Web Audio API vs. native, closing the gap, take 2"
abstract: "The situation has evolved quite a lot, with the addition of various features,not necessarily related to audio, in the last few years.Shared memory, atomics, SIMD, Audio Worklets, WASM, Web MIDI are some of the features that allow building programs that were impossible to write a few yearsago.This workshop will take a bottom up approach to writing high-performanceapplications with the Web Audio API, with a definitive focus towards writingreal-time audio code in the context of a web application.In doing this, the reasoning will follow a bottom-up approach: understanding theproperties needed for a specific system, and try to them map web platformconstructs, with a definitive focus on high-performance and white-box analysis.Links to implementations themselves and the primitives chosen will have animpact on the final quality of the result, in terms of rendering speed, memoryfootprint, robustness, and extensibility."
