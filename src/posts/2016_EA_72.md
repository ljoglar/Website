title: "OLOS: Visual Music Programming" 
abstract: "Olos is a graphical, web-based platform to play with music through code. It is a collection of modular web components: a visual programming environment, and a set of stand-alone components. Olos components provide a GUI layer of abstraction atop existing Web Audio API functionality. Within the Olos environment, the components become draggable and connectable. Global constraints such as tempo and key encourage musicality. Immediate auditory and visual feedback facilitates improvisation and computational thinking. Each component's source code can be modified directly with JavaScript in a live coding overlay. Emerging web technologies make the building blocks of audio accessible through the browser. Olos makes these elements more approachable for users who may not have experience with code or music."
