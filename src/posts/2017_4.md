title: "Improvise musical ...Loops with others thanks to your Wi-Fi device’s Web browser"
abstract: "During a 15 to 30 minutes live performance, members of the audience are invited to trigger and modulate sounds with their mobile device’s Web browsers.
They are offered a preset musical theme (composed of several melodic/rhythmic patterns, synthesizer presets and audio samples). Performers may modify these patterns or presets, make new versions of these and thus create a new musical theme.
During a collective live performance, players connected to the ...Loops system experience instrument switches so they may discover and play different musical parts (from drum samples and monophonic synthesizer step sequencers to touch keyboard triggered polyphonic synthesizers).
Notes played by the connected crowd are displayed on a video projected screen."
