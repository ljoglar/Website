title: "Capsule, A Modular Step Sequencer for Web Audio and MIDI" 
abstract: "Capsule is a modular composition and performance system developed with the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs. It is an attempt to combine the conceptual simplicity of a modular-style step sequencer with the algorithmic flexibility of a live coding language. Capsule presents a starting point that is familiar to a wide range of electronic musicians, and aims to be friendly for those new to electronic music as well. On top of this foundation is a collection of modules that can be added to a capsule to modify the progression of the sequence, add algorithmic modification to the sequence, and provide interaction methods for use in live performance. Each module is individually simple to learn and use; collectively, the modules build on each other flexibly to provide depth to the system. Capsule is designed to allow users to start immediately with an accessible, musically open sequencer. Over time, users can develop sophisticated compositional and performative strategies, with each stage designed to facilitate a rewarding music-making experience."
