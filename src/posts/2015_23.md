  title: "DAW Plugins for Web Browsers" 
  abstract: "A large collection of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) plugins is available on the Internet in open source form. This paper explores their reuse in browser environments, focusing on hosting options that do not require manual installation. Two options based on Emscripten and PNaCl are introduced, implemented, evaluated, and released as open source. We found that ported DAW effect and sound synthesizer plugins complement and integrate with the Web Audio API, and that the existing preset patch collections make the plugins readily usable in online contexts. The latency measures are higher than in native plugin implementations, but expected to reduce with the emerging AudioWorker node."
