  title: "Strategies for Per-Sample Processing of Audio Graphs in the Browser" 
  abstract: "Due to current browser limitations, most synthesis in the browser is currently performed using the block-rate nodes included in the WebAudio API. However, block-rate processing of audio graphs precludes many types of synthesis in addition to limiting both the accuracy and flexibility of scheduling. We describe alternative strategies for performing efficient, per-sample processing of audio graphs in the browser using the ScriptProcessor node, affording synthesis techniques that are not commonly found in existing JavaScript audio libraries. We introduce a new library, Genish.js, that provides unit generators for common low-level synthesis tasks and acts as a compiler for signal processing functions; this library is a loose port of the Gen framework for Max/MSP. We used Genish.js to update a higher-level library for audio programming, Gibberish.js, realizing improvements to both efficiency and audio quality. Preliminary benchmarks comparing the performance of Genish.js audio graphs to equivalent graphs made with the WebAudio API show promising results."
