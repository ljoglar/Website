title: "Live coding with Makkeróni - workshop"
abstract: "Makkeróni is a web-based live coding system which simulates a linux shell. The user operates with commands known from the BASH (ls, help, cat etc.), and also there are some audio-specific commands (play, freq, tone etc.). In this workshop we're going to learn how to use it, while possibly focusing on efficiency (pipes, joker characters, command history tricks) and network cooperation. If the participants are open for it, we could discuss the targets of further development as well.It's recommended for both new and experienced Linux shell users.Optimal length: 45-70minLink to the application: http://makker.hu/makkeroni/"
