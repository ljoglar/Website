title: "A 2 Million Commercial Song Interactive Navigator"
abstract: "In this paper, we present a web-based interactive tool for exploring a collection of two million commercially released songs. It gathers song information from a large number of heterogeneous sources, web-based and audio-based, and integrates work from multiple research groups. The resulting tool can be used to request information about a specific song such as lyrics, metadata and chords; to navigate further on to linked external resources such as Discogs, AllMusic, MusicBrainz or a number of streaming providers; or to browse the collection by artistâ€™s discographies or band membership. Several Web Audio applications are integrated and use the dataset to enrich the experience."
