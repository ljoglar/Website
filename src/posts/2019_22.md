title: "Join my party! How can we enhance social interactions in music streaming?"
abstract: "In this paper we examine ways to encourage social interactions in online music streaming platforms and discuss the challenges that emerge when deploying  browser-based music mixing systems. With the example of an interactive online application, that allows users to choose music collaboratively based on mood, create their own personal parties, as well as share their favourite tracks with other participants, we explore new alternatives for musical experiences in the context of social media on the one hand and music streaming on the other."
