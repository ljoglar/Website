title: "Csound Web-IDE"
abstract: "Csound Web-IDE is an open-source, browser-based integrated development environment (IDE) for sound and music computing using Csound. The web application offers users the ability to edit and run standard, multi-file Csound projects in the same way they would do on the desktop, mobile, and embedded platforms. Enabled by modern web technologies, envisioned use cases for the Web-IDE include computer music education, music composition, and development of realtime interactive systems, as well future integration with other WebAudio-based systems."
