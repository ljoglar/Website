  title: "Adaptive, Personalised ''in browser'' Audio Compression" 
  abstract: "Audio quality is very important to the BBC's audience, and unwanted loudness variations reduce the quality of the listeners' experience. Dynamic range control applied by the broadcaster can go some way to avoiding problems but, because the broadcaster cannot take into account each listener's individual environment, needs, or preference, it cannot please everyone all the time. The listening conditions are a significant factor to be taken into account when dynamic range control is applied. The Web Audio API offers the possibility of performing dynamic range control under the control of the listener, tailoring it optimally for their individual situation. We have developed a system that demonstrates that this is achievable in a modern web browser. In it, a compressor is controlled automatically by the environmental noise level measured using the microphone present in most mobile device audio players."
