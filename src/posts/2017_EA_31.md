title: "Live JS (performance)" 
abstract: "A completely live electronic music performance with visuals and lighting entirely powered by JavaScript. Following on from my submitted talk 'Is Web Audio ready for the stage/dancefloor', I along with other members of Live JS (http:// livejs.network) would like to demonstrate that it INDEED is ready! At JSConf.asia, we were given the opportunity to take over the entire venue (including their massive lighting rig) and broadcast our pirate JavaScript signal to everyone for the after party! We'll be doing something similar at JSConf.eu in May (if all goes to plan). Here is a video of our JSConf.asia talk (30mins) and full improvised performance: https://youtu.be/s3fsRnFfyuo?t=2131 Matt, Martin and Tim (possibly more of us, depending on who can come) will be dropping Web Audio powered samples, synthesisers, and looping using multiple midi controllers. We'll also be using JavaScript to drive a massive LED wall, realtime visuals and (if possible) moving head lighting via DMX."
