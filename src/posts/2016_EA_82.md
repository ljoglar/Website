title: "Live Writing: Shatter" 
abstract: "Live Writing: Shatter utilizes an audiovisual performance developed for a web browser. Here, every keystroke made on a laptop to write a piece of creative writing is captured and precessed to established natural links among typing gestures, text written, and audiovisual responses. The piece is built upon a poem written by Martinez about fragments of memories left by unspoken words. The performance capitalizes on temporal typography built on a web browser using Web Audio API, and Web Graphics Library, offering unique text animation sculpted with live audio to the audience."
