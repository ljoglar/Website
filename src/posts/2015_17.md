  title: "Meyda: an audio feature extraction library for the Web Audio API" 
  abstract: "There are many existing native libraries and frameworks for feature extraction used in multimedia information retrieval. Many are dependent on highly optimised low level to cope with the high performance requirements of audio analysis. In this paper, we present a new feature extractor library, Meyda, for use with the Web Audio API, and detail its benchmarking. Meyda provides the first library for audio feature in the web client, which will enable music information retrieval systems, complex visualisations and a wide variety of technologies and creative projects that previously were relegated to native software. The Meyda project, including source code and documentation is released under an MIT license."
