title: "Responsive Space. Liveness through spatial distribution of sound and image."
abstract: "In this project a performance framework called 'Responsive Space' has been created, which allows a flexible way of working with distributed sound and image projections. The system consists of a multichannel speaker-system, up to three video projections, a local Wifi network with a connected webserver and mobile devices. The audience is invited to log into the local network with their mobile devices. In the browser of the mobile devices sound and image is generated or streamed.This offers the possibility of a great diversity in the spatial distribution of sound and image. As experienced in previous projects with live audio-streaming and mobile devices the spatial gesture of music as a musical parameter comes to the fore. In the performances the audio is streamed with an icecast-server and visual output is generated with javascript on the client’s browser. The imperfection of time synchronization leads to very interesting effects. The awareness of space and the interaction of the audience with each other leads to the emergence of a social space in the concert.In addition to the dimension of space this setup also examines the relationship between different media layers. This is central for the question how to achieve 'liveness' - which in my opinion can also be achieved with this spatial arrangement and distribution of sound and image."
