The connection between sound and space represent a critical factor in the everyday listening experience. Understand the relation between ourselves and the environment through a primal study of the acoustic elements we perceive. Therefore, replace the environmental sounds with artificial sound sources over noise canceling headphones represent a way to drive that process: set the relation between listener and environment by designing an acoustic world to explore. In this respect, the work itself may be considered as a sort of 'sound sculpture.' The acoustic outcome is based on the actual location of the listener so that the sound change throughout space and provide a different result wherever on the planet. Cereris is an artwork that celebrates the vastity of the world we live in. In this hyper-connected reality we build for ourselves no place seems too far, while the truth is that they are and we will not be able to see most of them. Rediscover our real relationship with the environment through sound exploration."
