  title: "Diamonds in Dystopia" 
  abstract: "Diamonds in Dystopia is a body of work and web framework for creatively datamining large sources of text for mobile in-teraction. So far we have used it for live-streaming poetry performances at various locations such as SXSW Interactive and TEDx in addition to fine arts installations. As a perfor-mance it is a web driven app for incorporating improvisation into experiential storytelling. The audience acts as collab-orator by sending word selections by tapping language on their mobiles to trigger reactions to send a distilled, impro-visational stanza culled from a massive corpus of text to the poet on stage. The individual taps coming from the audi-ence also trigger synthesized audio effects at varying pitches to create a musical experience as well as contributing to a vi-sual projection of the poem and audience interactivity. Cre-ated by Vincent A. Cellucci (poet), Jesse Allison (Professor of Experimental Music), and Derick Ostrenko (Professor of Digital Art), the applications use natural language process-ing on text to generate an innovative media stage project. The app creators are interested in creative data mining and incorporating interactive media into performances that chal-lenge people's perceptions and expectations for the mediums of music, digital art and design, and poetry."
