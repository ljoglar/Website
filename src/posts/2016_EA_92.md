  title: "Causeway" 
  abstract: "Causeway is an interactive poetry app and performance written by Vincent A. Cellucci with audio by Jesse Allison and visuals by Derick Ostrenko. Originally a part of Cellucci's book, An Easy Place / To Die (CityLit 2011), the poem 'Causeway' was inspired by events following Hurricane Katrina. The piece can be experienced as a performance or by itself as a mobile application/installation. When Causeway—a 2-screen experience— is put on as a performance, Cellucci performs a reading of the poem while audience members interact by touching phrases from the poem on their mobile devices to collectively transform visuals displayed on a large projection. Each tap produces a sonic echo taken from Cellucci's voice and causes his words to ripple through the theater. As an application, this experience is containerized on the mobile device so that many users over time contribute to a collective visualization. Software utilized includes: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, OSC, Tone.js, Socket.IO, OpenStack, iOS, Max, and Android."
