title: "On our Past, Present, and Future with Web Audio Technologies – a participatory keynote address"
abstract: "(1) Since I am infected, I often have a hard time to enjoy concerts. Most of them feel like ancient rituals representing the idea that we are unable to listen to and adequately express ourselves towards each other when we are more than a few. These rituals seem to remind us that if we express ourselves we have to make the others listen and that if ever we are more than a few we have to follow a leader and/or a detailed script. Meaningful relationships are often pictured as requiring elaborated action plans and persevering repetition. I don’t really remember how this relates to my life.(2) Since I am infected, I don’t understand anymore why so many creators spend so much time on producing works which exclude their audience from the relationships they represent. At best, the audience is allowed to observe meticulously elaborated symbolic enactments from afar.(3) However, I appreciate the collective silence before the show, when all participants are united in mutual attention.(4) Like other communication technologies, web technologies extend our possibilities to create, maintain, and control our relationships to others.(5) Music consists in its essence of metaphors for the relationships our lives are made of and for the way we create, maintain, and control them.(6) What I always liked about digital music technologies is the possibility to constantly build new instruments and environments that play with these metaphors to embrace very different practices, people and communities.(7) What I particularly like about web technologies is how they allow for effortlessly creating networks of mutual attention and multilateral interaction that may stand as lively metaphors for open, diverse, and pluralistic societies."
