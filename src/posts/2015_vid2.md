title: "Building a Collaborative Digital Audio Workstation Based on the Web Audio API" 
abstract: "The introduction of the Web Audio API has enriched the web landscape enormously. It gives game developers the ability to add precisely timed, high performant sound effects and to create realistic spatialized sound landscapes. For many web developers it is the first time they encounter audio programming which leads to many interesting experiments when the world of web and audio collide. Traditional web developers start to become really interested in audio programming and educate themselves on the topic of synthesizers and audio effects. However, currently there are only few applications that try to create more sophisticates audio production tools in the browser. In this talk I want to show how I used the Web Audio API and other emerging web standards like WebRTC to create a collaborative digital audio workstation. It allows users to record, arrange and create their own songs in collaboration with other users in real time. http://web-audio-editor.herokuapp.com/"
