title: "Audio oriented UI components for the web platform" 
abstract: "This paper presents a set of web-native tools for visualising and interacting with time-based objects. These visualisations are rendered as part of the document using web standard technologies, allowing for an easy integration and interaction with the elements on the same document without the help of non-native technologies such as Adobe Flash, Microsoft's Silverlight or Oracle's Java."
