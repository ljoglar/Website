title: "Three Pidgins: Live Coding Performance"
abstract: "We present Three Pidgins, a live coding musical performance as an example of the live coding systems created with Sema, our web audio-based technology. Using three bespoke mini-languages, Kiefer, Bernardo and Magnusson will collaborate on a co-located networked musical performance where music is live-coded in real time. Each of the languages serves as an instrument in the ensemble of three."
