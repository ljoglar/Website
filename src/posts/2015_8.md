title: "Towards the Next Generation of Web-based Experiments: A Case Study Assessing Basic Audio Quality Following the ITU-R Recommendation BS. 1534 (MUSHRA)" 
abstract: "Listening tests are widely used to assess the quality of audio systems. The majority of such listening tests is conducted in controlled environments with selected participants and professional audio equipment. In the last few years, conducting listening tests over the Internet, as so called web-based experiments, has become popular. A recent study has shown that web-based experiments lead to comparable results as laboratory experiments. Until now, it was only possible to implement a limited number of listening test types as web-based experiments because web standards were missing some crucial features, e. g. sample manipulation of audio streams. With the upcoming of the Web Audio API, a much wider range of listening test types can be implemented as new audio processing features have been introduced. This paper demonstrates which new possibilities are enabled by the Web Audio API. To this end, the ITU-R Recommendation BS.1534 (MUSHRA) is taken as an example."
