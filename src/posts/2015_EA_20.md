title: "Quint.js: A JavaScript library for teaching music technology to fine arts students" 
abstract: "This paper presents quint.js, a JavaScript library for making interactive HTML/SVG/Web Audio “applets”. Two-dimensional geometric structures (“machines”) that are based in SVG vector graphics with audible feedback synthesized through Web Audio are used to demonstrate various physical, acoustic, and psychoacoustic phenomena and are applied in teaching music technology courses to fine arts students. The current core quint.js library and extension modules are a starting point for more extensive integration of Web Audio to support the delivery of course content and for the creation of integrated, interactive lecture notes."
