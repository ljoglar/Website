  title: "Hyperconnected Action Painting" 
  abstract: "This performance invites the audience to participate in an immersive experience using their mobile devices. The aim is at capturing their actions on a digital painting inspired by Jackson Pollock's action painting technique. The audience is connected to a wireless network and a Web Audio ap- plication that recognizes a number of gestures through the mobile accelerometer sensor, which trigger different sounds. Gestures will be recognized and mapped to a digital can- vas. A set of loudspeakers will complement the audience's actions with ambient sounds. The performance explores au- dio spatialization using both loudspeakers and mobile phone speakers, that combined with the digital painting provides an immersive audiovisual experience. The final digital can- vas will be available online as a memory of the performance."
