title: "Hyperconnected Action Painting" 
abstract: "This performance invites the audience to participate in an immersive experience using their mobile devices. The aim is at capturing their actions on a digital painting inspired by Jackson Pollock's action painting technique. The audience is connected to a wireless network and a Web Audio application that recognizes a number of gestures through the mobile accelerometer sensor, which trigger different sounds. Gestures will be recognized and mapped to a digital canvas. A set of loudspeakers will complement the audience's actions with ambient sounds. The performance explores audio spatialization using both loudspeakers and mobile phone speakers, that combined with the digital painting provides an immersive audiovisual experience. The final digital canvas will be available online as a memory of the performance."
