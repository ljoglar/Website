title: "Towards a Framework for the Discovery of Collections of Live Music Recordings and Artefacts on the Semantic Web" 
abstract: "This paper introduces a platform for the representation and discovery of live music recordings and associated artefacts based on a dedicated data model. We demonstrate our technology by implementing a Web-based discovery tool for the Grateful Dead collection of the Internet Archive, a large collection of concert recordings annotated with editorial metadata. We represent this information using a Linked Data model complemented with data aggregated from several additional Web resources discussing and describing these events. These data include descriptions and images of physical artefacts such as tickets, posters and fan photos, as well as other information, e.g. about location and weather. The system uses signal processing techniques for the analysis and alignment of the digital recordings. During the discovery, users can juxtapose and compare dierent recordings of a given concert, or different performances of a given song by interactively blending between them."
