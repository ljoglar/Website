  title: "Soundworks - A Playground for Artists and Developers to Create Collaborative Mobile Web Performances" 
  abstract: "We present Soundworks, a Javascript framework that enables artists and developers to create collaborative music performances where a group of participants distributed in space use their smartphones to generate sound and light through touch and motion. The framework adopts a modular architecture to make it easy to implement different performance scenarios, using a server / client architecture supported by Node.js and socket.io. We provide a boilerplate that allows anyone to bootstrap a scenario for Soundworks and focus on its audiovisual and interaction design instead of the infrastructure. We developed three scenarios based on Soundworks: Wandering Sound, Drops, and Paths. Each scenario has been tested multiple times with teenagers during workshops at the Centre Pompidou's Studio 13/16 in Paris. We present the results of these live tests."
