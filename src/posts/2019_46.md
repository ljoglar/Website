title: "The new WAC website: towards a sustainable conference"
abstract: "Started in 2015,  WAC is a young conference,  but has also reached  a  maturity  state  with  regular  1-1.5  year  intervals between  editions.   There  is  however  a  lack  of  consistency between the conference proceedings which makes them difficult to index and find.  Also, publications often include associated audiovisual media.  We have created a centralized website with the proceedings indexed consistently combined with other relevant information.  We have also developed a collection of guidelines and designed the website in a format that can be used by the forthcoming conference organizers. In this talk, we will present the new website, the project workflow, and the tools and libraries used for development. We  will  also  reflect  on  the  lessons  learned  and  a  set  of recommendations to keep the conference sustainable."
