  title: "Concert for Smartphones" 
  abstract: "The performance involves audience participation with their mobile devices. Connected to a wireless network and organized into one polyphonic multichannel synthesizer, those devices reproduce different noises, samples, and synthesized sounds from random locations in the hall. In addition, loudspeakers complement the phone choir to add dynamic climaxes and low-frequency effects. The name of the performance refers to academic music traditions. The author emphasizes the similarity in musical nature of the Concert for Smartphones and any classical concert for soloist and orchestra. The performance is an experiment in exploring possible ways of using an audience's mobile devices as a medium for sound diffusion in the context of a traditionally composed electroacoustic musical piece."
