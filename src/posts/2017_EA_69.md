  title: "Sonification and Visualization of Parametric Equations" 
  abstract: "This paper describes how parametric equations can be sonified using the Web Audio API and visualized us- ing a vectorscope built using the HTML5 canvas el- ement. A working demonstration can be found at academo.org/demos/vectorscope, with a selection of user- adjustable parametric equations, including Lissajous figures and hypotrochoids."
