title: "Sonification and Visualization of Parametric Equations" 
abstract: "This paper describes how parametric equations can be sonified using the Web Audio API and visualized using a vectorscope built using the HTML5 canvas element. A working demonstration can be found at academo.org/demos/vectorscope, with a selection of useradjustable parametric equations, including Lissajous figures and hypotrochoids."
