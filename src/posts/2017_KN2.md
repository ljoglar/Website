title: "Keynote #2 Distributed Listening - A Practitioner's Perspective" 
abstract: "The sonorous network has changed how we make and listen to music in many exciting but also challenging ways. Whereas traditional performance spaces exude notions of unity, togetherness, coherence and situatedness, the network has challenged performers to listen closely to the superimposition of acoustics, while being confronted with the socially dynamic and the often musically unknown. As performers we find ourselves in this almost schizophrenic state of being in a distant and sonically less identifiable space (something we grasp better with our ears), while also occupying a rather intimate and embodied listening space (something we grasp with our ears but also through touch). As a performer I will draw on a few musical performance scenarios to explore this sonic fl√¢nerie, a musicking where our ear is urged to reach across nodes, and which ultimately positions listening as a corporeal and multi-dimensional experience that is continuously being re-shaped by technological, socio-political and cultural concerns."
