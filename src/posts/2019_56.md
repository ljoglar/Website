title: "Cooperation experiments in web-based audiovisual works"
abstract: "Network possibilities are inherently ready for real-time cooperation among the users of the same website, in order to participate in running a multimedia installation, webaudio instrument, or audio-game. In this paper I summarize my works in this field, starting from web-only projects (Webcards, Forgattató, WebSynth), finishing at communication between locative installations and the web (Ring the Web!). Most of them are radically cooperative, which means that they aren't running stand-alone or even off-line because of their multi-user approach. With this initiative I argue that networked audiovisual artworks and instruments realize a communicative way of performing."
