abstract: "The web has supported multiple media since its inception however, only recently has it become a viable platform for building audio applications. The talk will examine the journey of audio in the web platform, the intersection of interesting technologies that make this a pivotal point for audio and the web, and will highlight the opportunities unlocked by web audio and where we go from here.

He has separate and combined passions for digital audio, music and the web, and co-edits the Web Audio and Web MIDI specifications at the W3C.
