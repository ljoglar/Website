title: "Drops #2"
abstract: "Drops #2 is a collective improvisation for an unlimited number of players who are partially co-located in a common space, partially connected remotely over the internet.
The players trigger sounds and interact through their mobile devices by touching the screen whereby the sounds played by each player are repeated by the devices of two other players.
The sound is played via the loudspeakers of the players' mobile devices.
Around each player unfolds a complex entanglement of different layers of sound.
The player's sound is embedded into the polyphony generated by the players at immediate proximity as well as into the sound texture created by all players together.
The sound of the players' mobile devices is completed by an resonating low-pitch sound texture.
This sound texture is associated to the video projection of an earth globe that visualizes all drops at the geolocation position of their player."
