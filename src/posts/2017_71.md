title: "Sunspots"
abstract: "Sunspots is a web art piece that allows the audience to explore a virtual 3D world. It is an interactive component to a physical audio release on dual-LP vinyl (also called Sunspots), allowing the material to go beyond fixed-media representation. Three environments can be navigated, each with their own audio and visual textures. The visuals make use of Three.js and custom shaders to allow for strange cloth-based physical simulations live in the browser. WebAudio is used for creation and spatialization of the sound in the 3D environment. 
The audio for each environment is generated by overlapping multiple channels of "instruments" that are created by randomly loading different short segments of closely-related analog synthesizer material. The idea is to create generative versions of the pieces on the album that will vary endlessly and create a unique user experience.
