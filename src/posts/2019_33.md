title: "Design of a real-time multiparty DAW collaboration application using Web MIDI and WebRTC APIs"
abstract: "Collaborative music production in online environments has seen a renewed focus as developers of Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software include features that cater to limited synchronous participation and multiparty asynchronous collaboration. A significant restriction of these collaboration platforms is the inability for multiple collaborators to effectively communicate and seamlessly work on a high-fidelity audio project in real-time. This paper outlines the design of a browser-based application that enables real-time collaboration between multiple remote instantiations of an established, mainstream and fully-featured DAW platform over the Internet. The proposed application provides access to, and modification and creation of, high-fidelity audio assets, real-time videoconferencing and control data streaming for communication and synchronised DAW operations through Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) and Web MIDI Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The paper reports on a proof-of-concept implementation and results, including several areas for further research and development."
