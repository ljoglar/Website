title: "DIALECTIC IN SUSPENSE"
abstract: "A sound work about the conflicting relation between nature and contradictory human development. Natural spaces and ambient sounds mixed with residual human pollution are combined with real-time audio and data processing that shows both human and nature strategies to overcome the critical anthropocentric presence. The work has three different movements bringing the public the opportunity to enhance their environmental conscience and perspective about it. 
No-input technique will be used not just as a compositional resource but as a metaphor: the sound made by the residual noise of human-made equipment. The noise will be treated through delays, looper, ring modulator, different distortions, filters. In parallel, a pre-analysis based on MIR stored in a database is combined with real-time processing and synthesis, random processes and human control via external interfaces. Historical climate data is used to model sound in real-time."
