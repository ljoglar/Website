title: "FutureCollider: Generative Sonification of Large Hadron Collider data using Tone.JS"
abstract: "FutureCollider is an interactive sonification of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider.
The dataset consists of predictions of particle identity, trajectory, momentum and energy, generated by running an unsupervised learning algorithm on a dataset from the CERN Open Data Portal. As these collisions have not occurred yet, the listener is exploring a sonification of future particle collisions.
The vertical scroll position affects the timbre, tempo and progress of the music, transforming a gesture associated with passive information consumption into active musical engagement.
The audio itself is triggered and synthesised using Tone.js, a Web Audio framework, allowing every part of the audio to vary in response to the userâ€™s input."
