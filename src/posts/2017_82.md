title: "Diamonds in Dystopia"
abstract: "Diamonds in Dystopia is a body of work and web framework for creatively datamining large sources of text and incorporating improvisation into experiential storytelling. The audience acts as collaborator by selecting words to trigger reactions generating and sending distilled, improvisational phrases culled from a massive corpus of text to the poet on stage. The individual taps coming from the audience also trigger synthesized audio effects to create a musical experience and contributing to a visual projection of the generated poem. The creators are interested in creative data mining and incorporating interactive media into performances that challenge peopleâ€™s perceptions and expectations for the mediums of music, digital art and design, and poetry."
