title: "Sound Colour Space – A Virtual Museum*" 
abstract: "By investigating the conceptual field of sound, tone, pitch, and timbre in its relation to visual phenomena and geometrical concepts, the project Sound Colour Space – A Virtual Museum contributes to an interdisciplinary field of research and explores its adequate modes of representation and communication. Many scientists and philosophers from antiquity to modern times have studied the relationships between sound, light and geometry. Many of their visualisations of acoustical, optical and perceptual topics speak to the eye and can be studied comparatively. These pictures are interesting because of their diagrammatic structure, in the way they combine text, images and spatial structures on a flat surface and in the way they address topological, philosophical and psychological questions. They often have an aesthetic value of their own. In addition to the development of an exemplary online publication, interactive audiovisual examples were created, which also were used for artistic projects."
