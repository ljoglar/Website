title: "Collaborative Coding with Music: Two Case Studies with EarSketch" 
abstract: "This paper describes the motivation, design, and implementation of new features in EarSketch that enable the collaborative creation of algorithmic music. EarSketch is a web-based Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), designed primarily for educational contexts, in which users author Python or JavaScript code to programmatically create music within a multi-track paradigm. In this paper, we describe these new collaborative features in EarSketch and discuss their potential for use in both educational and music performance contexts."
