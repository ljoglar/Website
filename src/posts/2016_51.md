title: "myMoodplay: An interactive mood-based music discovery app" 
abstract: "myMoodplay is a web app that allows users to interactively discover music by selecting desired emotions. The application uses the Web Audio API, JavaScript animation for visualisation, linked data formats and affective computing technologies. We explore how artificial intelligence, semantic web and audio synthesis can be combined to provide new personalised online musical experiences. Users can choose degrees of energy and pleasantness to shape the desired musical mood trajectory. Semantic Web technologies have been embedded in the system to query mood coordinates from a triple store using a SPARQL endpoint and to connect to external linked data sources for metadata."
